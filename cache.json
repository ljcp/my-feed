Instead of a manual inspection, you can leverage automation for broken link testing using Selenium WebDriver.\nWhen a particular link is broken and a visitor lands on the page, it affects that page’s functionality and results in a poor user experience.

Do you know that 2.5 quadrillion bytes of information are generated each day? \nConsidering the rate at which data is produced and utilized all across the globe, the acquisition of sophisticated measures for the protection of such data is something that must not be neglected by enterprises of all sizes at any cost. Keeping in view the swift pace of progression in identity theft cases, robust mechanisms such as real-time identity verification solutions, especially document verification must be incorporated for the enhancement of security protocols and to combat illicit money transfers, counterfeits, chargebacks, and other relevant fraudulent activities.",

With skyrocketing data scale and stringent requirements on data freshness, big data-related scenarios are becoming complicated and multi-dimensional. Thus, many companies use real-time data warehouses to meet their business demand.\nBut data warehouses are not the only option. An emerging category of databases, Hybrid Analytical/Transactional Processing (HTAP) databases, can serve you just as well as data warehouses, if not better. HTAP databases can handle Online Transactional Processing (OLTP) workloads and respond quickly to big data analytical requests in real time.",

A robust incident management strategy eventually leads to better management and handling of issues. It is an essential part of reliability engineering, ensuring that a team is prepared to manage incidents. It can prevent the loss of millions of dollars in revenue in times of breaches or downtimes. Good incident management improves customer experience and empowers engineering teams to meet their uptime goals. \nIn this blog, we will discuss how companies can identify and prioritize incidents for faster resolution. Incidents could vary a lot on the surface level, and hence it is essential to classify them according to specific, well-defined parameters. All incidents are not equal.

Integration facilitates the transmission of information between systems and may be realized through the use of technologies such as messaging systems, API gateways, and their associated protocols (MQ, AMQP, HTTP, FTP). Over the years, many technology vendors have implemented additional capabilities within their integration products that have enabled developers to add business logic embedded within the integration solution. This has resulted in business logic being spread outside of the application layer and integration an integration system that is often managed and maintained by a single team resulting in a resource bottleneck.",

          "description": "What is a Graceful Shutdown?\nThe Graceful and the Hard (or Abrupt) shutdown are the two methods of stopping an application. When an application is running, it performs certain tasks or processes client requests. While doing so, it consumes various resources, makes connections, persists data, and/or handles transactions, etc. We may want to stop a running application, in order to take it out of the system or to release a different version of the application, as part of the deployment. However, it is important to analyze and understand the consequences of abruptly stopping an application, and such consequences are purely based on the application functionality and its role in the overall system.\nIn order to explain in detail, the Graceful vs Hard or abrupt stopping of an application is similar to stopping a computer. When we use the shutdown function of an operating system it prompts for any unsaved work or closing of some important applications. In contrast, when we do a Hard shutdown, we lose any unsaved files or unfinished works. Interestingly, the same logic applies to applications. Some applications are capable of resuming any unfinished tasks when they are restarted. Thus, for such applications, abrupt stops don’t cause any harm. On the other hand, for some applications, an abrupt shutdown may result in unwanted outcomes. For example, failure of very large transactions, or opened resources, etc. Thus, while writing an application we should also pay attention to its shutdown procedure.",

The two formats featured in today’s tutorial are JSON and XML. Both formats are widely used in web-based applications, but one may be more ideal than the other for certain objects. JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) is defined as an open standard file and data-interchange format that uses human-readable text to store and exchange data. It was initially developed from JavaScript, but as a language-independent format it can be used in many different programming languages. Due to its versatility, efficient design, and low cost, JSON has become a go-to for many businesses. \nOur other format, Extensible Markup Language (XML), is similar to JSON in that they both are easy to read, create, and decode. However, XML uses prescribed tags that divide information according to its traits and has limiting factors associated with characters (i.e. !”*(), etc.). While this option may contain a higher word count due to the tags, it does allow for more precision in how data is read by the computer, including improved metadata usability, which is unavailable in JSON.",

This kind of defeats the purpose, doesn’t it? HDFS stores small files inefficiently, leading to inefficient Namenode memory utilization and RPC calls, block-scanning throughput degradation, and reduced application layer performance. If you are a big data administrator on any modern data lake, you will invariably come face to face with the problem of small files. Distributed file systems are great but let's face it, the more you split storage layers the greater your overhead is when reading those files. So the idea is to optimize the file size to best serve your use case, while also actively optimizing your data lake.",

Each of these services run in its own process and are independently deployable. They may have been developed in different programming languages and may use different data storage techniques and communicate with each other via lightweight mechanisms like RESTful APIs, message queues etc. Now that services(API clients) need to know how to interact with each other, there is a need of API documentation that should be clear, informative, and easy to go through.\nOpenAPI makes documenting these RESTful services very easy and can be done by adding few annotations to a Spring-based project. Besides rendering documentation, it allows the API consumers to interact with the APIs without having their own implementation logic in place. Also, it can be used to generate the API client libraries for over 50+ languages. In this post, I’ll cover how to use OpenAPI to generate REST API documentation and Java clients for a Spring Boot project.",

There are several languages, a framework which built an out-of-the-box connector for MongoDB just like how JDBC connectors help to connect Java programs to an RDBMS, for example, Mongoose as a module under NodeJS, available through npm and this is one of the key components in MEAN (MongoDB, Express, AngularJS, Node.js) or MERN (MongoDB, Express, ReactJS, Node.js) stacks.\nOver the years many such platforms have realized that just having a database will not help to build the platform, the need is to help build a Cloud Native solution with Database-as-a-Service aka DaaS is the future. This means the platform needs to support API as the key enabler to connect to various consumers.

While the old on-prem model made sense in the earlier days of computing, the rapidly expanding suite of cloud providers, along with their infinite combinations of settings and services, now places an extraordinary burden on security teams to become cloud-centric. An enterprise that doesn't fully understand its role in securing its data in the public cloud is taking unnecessary risks with its outdated security strategies.\nIn the traditional data center, the network provided a secure boundary for the organization. The network was carved up into zones and trusts were established within and between zones. Security architectures were established and tools deployed based on this strategy, which largely involved monitoring the traffic flows and enforcing controls where the zones met. But in the cloud, this approach is no longer relevant. Time and again, in breach after breach, headline after headline, the modern attack cycle, particularly in the cloud, starts with identity. Attackers seek access to the identity, then pivot between resources, discovering credentials and other identities that give them more and more access to get what they want.",

Kafka is optimized for writing the stream data in binary format, which basically logs everything directly to the file system (Sequential I/O) and makes a minimum effort to process what's in the data (Optimize for Zero Copy).  Kafka is super-charged at making sure data is stored as quickly as possible, and quickly replicating for a large number of consumers. But terrible at communication, the client that pushes content needs to SPEAK Kafka.",

Businesses understand that in order to survive and keep up with their competitors, they need to lean heavily into the cloud and embrace it as part of their digital transformation strategy. According to a recent survey of C-suite executives, almost 90% of organizations now understand that cloud technology is going to be a critical step on their path to success. But are they running before they’ve learned to walk? \nBusinesses that run headlong into cloud-native transformations tend to do so with an idealized view of what it is they want to achieve. They invest heavily and devote their most valuable resources to trying to achieve the perfect transformation, pinning all of their future successes on it. However, we all know that true perfection is unobtainable, and in pursuing it so doggedly we often cut corners and miss opportunities along the way. The ‘rush to cloud’ has only been exacerbated by the pandemic, pushing companies to up their investments and accelerate their plans for cloud transformation. But rather than speeding up, some of these businesses might be better off slowing down to figure out where they're going and how to get there.",

Disaggregation involves decoupling data center resources of memory, compute and storage, so that each resource can be scaled and provisioned independently. Disaggregation is already widely adopted in cloud computing platforms, with various clouds offering storage systems that are completely independent of compute instances.\nDisaggregated storage is a version of composable disaggregated infrastructure that offers scalable storage by connecting various physical storage devices over a network fabric to form a logical storage pool, in some cases on demand. Disaggregated storage enables the creation of dynamic environments where the compute and storage resources scale elastically based on the application’s workload. Separating storage and compute instances also means that storage can be scaled and managed without interfering with the availability of an application’s services.",

Since it would be impossible to manually go through all of the data and delete the duplicates, companies have come up with machine learning solutions that perform such work for them. Today we would like to take a look at some interesting uses of machine learning to catch duplicates in all kinds of environments. Before we dive right in, let’s take a look at how machine learning systems work.\nHow Do Machine Learning Systems Identify Duplicates?\nWhen a person looks at an image or two strings of data it would be fairly easy for them to determine whether or not the images or strings are duplicates. However, how would you train a machine to spot such duplicates? Perhaps a good starting point would be to identify all of the similarities, but then you would need to explain exactly what 'similar' means. Are there gradations to similarities? In order to overcome such challenges, researchers use string metrics to train machine learning models.",

If you’re not familiar with APIOps Cycles, take a look at this guide which provides an agile framework to quickly build APIs that are business-oriented and serve customer needs. API Observability itself is an evolution of traditional monitoring and born out of control systems theory.\nTraditional monitoring focuses on tracking known unknowns. This means you already know what to measure like Request Per Second or Errors Per Second. While the metric value may be unknown beforehand, you already know what to measure or probe such as a counter to track requests into buckets. This makes it possible to report on the health of a system (like Red, Yellow, Green), but is a bad tool for troubleshooting engineering or business issues which usually require asking arbitrary questions.",

It is a Spring Boot/Thymeleaf web application with the mission to display on a map the employees from an organization. It can display a particular employee on the map, all the employees on the map, and during the creation of an employee, it allows picking an address from a pinpoint on a map.

If something is flawed, it affects the whole function.

When a function has a meaningful name, it's easy to read and understand its purpose.\nFor example, if a function's purpose is to find a customer by ID, a good name could be findCustomerById(id: String). It could also just as well be findCustomer(id: String) because the function signature implies that the customer is found by their ID. The word find also implies that the customer might be found or it might not be found.\nIf the function's name would be changed to getCustomer(id: String), its meaning changes because now it implies that there's no fallback; the customer is either found or the function fails miserably and maybe throws an exception.\nBoth are valid names for a function but they have a different meaning and therefore their implementations should also be different.",

Complicating the battle somewhat is that you will also find respected industry experts, such as Martin Fowler, stating that some “consider microservices to be one form of SOA, perhaps service orientation done right”.\nMartin goes on to declare: “The problem…is that SOA means too many different things and that most of the time we come across something called 'SOA' [there is]…a focus on ESBs (Enterprise Service Buses) used to integrate monolithic applications. This common manifestation of SOA has led some microservice advocates to reject the SOA label entirely”. As such, for the remainder of this article, I will assume the use of ESB middleware as a fundamental characteristic of SOA landscapes, as well as representing the most fundamental distinction there is between SOA and REST.",

The contractor was in panic and concerned that she'd just lost four days worth of work by executing an older version of her application which included a hardcoded TRUNCATE statement. There was no backup available either. We were faced with a situation where we were going to miss customer timeline and lose the precious time reloading the data. We are talking about a multi-TB dataset. Once I had some coffee and we huddled to disucss next steps, we agreed the best next option is to leverage CockroachDB capability where dropped data does not leave the filesystem until garbage collection is complete, which by default is set to 25hours and luckily for us, that property was not changed in the cluster.

          "description": "Our new mantra for managing and maintaining the health and functionality of our apps and environments is observability. Observability is the quality of software, services, platforms, or products that allows us to understand how systems are behaving. Without the new sources of data giving us insights, our modern cloud-native applications would be quite a challenge to monitor. Observability, that deep data, is the new fuel for our developer and DevOps engineers.\nThe duality of observability is controllability. Observability is the ability to infer the internal state of a 'machine' from externally exposed signals. Controllability is the ability to control input to direct the internal state to the desired outcome. While driving, observing a red stoplight means controlling our vehicle by pressing the breaks (or in some modern vehicles, having the brakes applied automatically for us).",

As software development marches towards the cloud, we soon realize that this shift warrants the need to rethink our debugging strategies. This is because as software systems are now leveraging these advancements in cloud computing and distributed systems we see gaps emerging in debugging that cannot be satisfied by the traditional methods of logging and breakpoints.\nFor example, a major issue while using breakpoints is that the codebase needs to be run in debug mode. Therefore, we are not actually replicating the actual state of our systems taking into consideration multi-threading, distributed services, and dependencies on remote services in a cloud-native environment along with multi-service architecture. Similarly, logs offer no respite, as they may be cumbersome and even costly to execute and store.",

Whether we are filling out an online form, sending a text on our phone, or writing an email, it is a fact that many of our business and personal interactions require efficiently written (typed) language. Due to this heavy reliance on electronic communication, it is critical to ensure your online platform has a support system built-in to account for human error; if your application or website allows input or search queries from users, you run the risk of your systems not understanding the text due to spelling errors — and this is where spellcheck comes in.\nWhen you stop and consider how many times you encounter spellcheck in your electronic interactions, it should become clear that it has created a huge failsafe for our often rushed and impatient natures. Spellcheck has come a long way since its beginnings; the first spellcheckers simply verified words instead of suggesting corrections. Fast forward to our current era and spellcheckers have improved in both functionality and efficiency; they operate in the background of our applications and let us know with a red line that we have made a potential error. This is often accomplished with Natural Language Processing (NLP) which, as we have discussed previously, enables computers to process and interpret human language in the form of text or audio data.",

          "description": "Every time I travel to Japan, something that strikes me is how process-driven the Japanese people and culture seem to be. Even something as simple as buying a train ticket is an intricately refined process. The ticket seller first makes sure they have heard and understood you correctly, repeating back your exact request before they print the tickets. And once they’re printed out, they will pick up a pen and check each detail of the ticket — before going through each check again with you. You will be given exact and clear instructions on how to locate the platform and when to expect the train. And you’ll notice that when the train arrives and stops at the platform, the driver also has a checklist they will diligently follow. It’s incredible to observe, but not arbitrary — they do this because they have found it reduces error rates by up to 85% and ensures everything runs smoothly.\nYou might be wondering what Japan has to do with successfully coaching teams, particularly within an Agile framework. And the answer is Shu Ha Ri. This Japanese concept, roughly translated to “first learn, then detach, and finally, transcend” (or more simply: walk, run, fly) is a way of thinking about the stages of learning from beginner to master — and a key philosophy used in the martial art Aikido. Working in an Agile way requires much learning of new rituals, processes, and different ways of thinking, so if you are a scrum master, this concept can be a very useful one for understanding and guiding you in how to be a better team coach and ensuring that each project runs just as smoothly (and to time) as a bullet train.",

Memory is more important than throughput on containerized microservices on Kubernetes because:\nIt's more expensive due to permanence (unlike CPU cycles)\nMicroservices multiply the overhead cost\nOne monolith application becomes N microservices (e.g., 20 microservices ≈ 20GB)\nThis significantly impacts serverless function development and the Java deployment model. This is because many enterprise developers chose alternatives such as Go, Python, and Nodejs to overcome the performance bottleneck—until now, thanks to Quarkus, a new Kubernetes-native Java stack. This article explains how to optimize Java performance to run serverless functions on Kubernetes using Quarkus.",

This article discusses a complete example.\nIf you’ve worked in enterprise Java projects you will remember good old Web Services Description Language, the XML based format for describing network services by IBM and Microsoft. Maybe you still work with it? WSDL and its twin XML Schema are among those W3C standards that seasoned developers love to hate. Its specification files are not very human readable, let alone human writable. Fortunately you don't have to.

Orleans powers a number of large-scale Microsoft systems such as Xbox Game Services, Skype, Azure IoT, Azure ML, Azure Active Directory, and many more cloud services outside Microsoft. So if you’ve ever played online multiplayer games like Halo or Call of Duty, our team built much of the underlying infrastructure that supports it.\nWhen I originally joined Orleans, cloud computing was still in its infancy. We had a 10,000-foot vision and not a single line of actual code. We needed to reimagine how cloud-scale applications should be coded because, at the time, available and high-performance scalable systems were only achievable by experts.

I have blogged about this before, but the server was limited to 1 CPU core and 1 GB of RAM in that post. In this post, we're going to create a server with up to 4 CPU cores and 24 GB of RAM! That’s more than enough resources to host a game with 20+ friends with excellent performance (and still have enough leftover to create another server for something else). And best of all, it’s absolutely free! Forever!! I’m sure you’re just as excited as I am about this, so let’s jump right into it and get started!\nWhy Is This a Big Deal? \nIn this post, we’re going to launch a new OCI Virtual Machine that uses a new Ampere Arm chip. These VMs provide better price-performance and near-linear scaling for CPU-bound workloads compared to x86-based instances. They are suitable for a wide range of workloads including web applications, media encoding, AI Inferencing, and much more. We’re very proud that Oracle is now partnering with leading technology vendors to make Arm server-side development first-class and easy.",

Conventional wisdom says that if you praise people, they are motivated to do better.\n\n\n \nPeople who have been praised throughout their life by their well-meaning parents, friends, and teachers for their talent and smartness or those who have experienced extreme focus on talent and smartness throughout their childhood learn to value only intelligence. No wonder when these people enter the workforce, they continue to seek approval and demand praise every step of the way.\n\n\n \nEvery opportunity is a measure of their intelligence — do I look smart, how will I be judged, what if others find my ideas dumb.

Although functions based on virtual machine architecture in the 1.0 phase made this paradigm very popular, as the graphic below shows, there were limits around execution time, protocols, and poor local-development experience.\nDevelopers then realized that they could apply the same serverless traits and benefits to microservices and Linux containers. This launched the 1.5 phase, where some serverless containers completely abstracted Kubernetes, delivering the serverless experience through Knative or another abstraction layer that sits on top of it.",

          "description": "When building applications and programs for use by other developers, ensuring you are utilizing valid code identifiers is an important component. These unique identifiers are symbols that have been designated to specific program elements essential to the successful creation of a program, and they can refer to a wide variety of features, including class, namespace, types, variables, and more. To avoid any confusion or misinterpretation, the names given to the symbols should clearly indicate the usage of the corresponding element. The general idea is to create an identity of sorts for the symbol so that it can easily be identified by any individual, not just the original developer.\nDuring the creation of these integral program pieces, it is also important to be conscious of the technical nuances of the applicable programming language; for example, since Java is case sensitive, identifiers that have different cases will be treated differently. As you may know, attempting to navigate the various rules and requirements for code identifiers can take up a lot of time, so we are going to highlight an easy tool you can integrate to do the work for you. The following API can be run in Java to validate input identifiers and analyze for incorrect strokes including usage of whitespace, hyphens, underscores, and other special symbols within the identifier. This is accomplished by configuring input rules for the symbols, such as allowing the identifier “helloWorld” but not \"hello*World\".",

We also hear a lot about Sentiment (which technically is not a separate feature but rather a specialization of the previous two). Finally, we have POS-tagging, which is only occasionally mentioned outside of deeply technical articles for linguists and NLP professionals. \nWe don’t hear much about other NLP capabilities, and this is mainly because often, depending on how an NLP engine is designed, features beyond Categorization and Extraction are not present at all. Specifically, many NLP solutions today are based on Machine Learning algorithms, and ML rarely delivers great accuracy in problems that require both elevated precision and super-fine identification. Then again, some of these capabilities are incredibly useful, in fact sometimes even the only way to address a particular challenge. In the following, I make the case for one of these not-so-popular NLP tools: SAO (Subject-Action-Object).",

First, we have to configure everything from the integrated development environment (IDE) to build tools such as Maven or Gradle. We also need to configure the command-line tools used for containerization and generating the Kubernetes manifest. If we don’t want to spin up a Kubernetes cluster locally, we also must connect to a remote Kubernetes cluster for continuous testing and deployment.\nDevelopers should spend less time on configuration and more time accelerating the inner-loop development cycle of building, testing, and deploying our applications. Ideally, we should be able to continuously develop applications in a pre-configured Kubernetes environment.",

The value of synergy is always greater than the value of individual components contributing to it and this force multiplier needs to be capitalized in a massive way by modern-day enterprises if they wish to succeed in the digital economy.\nThe advertisement moolah that Google and Facebook rake in is precisely because they do not look at their business entities in siloes; rather they connect and integrate valuable customer data points from various entities like; for example, Gmail, Google Maps, and YouTube to generate one unified persona related data impression that becomes the basis for their targeted advertisements and their consequent success rates. Likewise, Netflix integrates and converts data on the subscriber consumption pattern to intelligent movie recommendations that lead to higher viewership, greater new subscriptions, and improved Net Promoter Scores (read word of mouth).",

Ask almost any MySQL DBA, and you will hear something like:\n\"MySQL is not a fit!\"\n\"Have you looked into NoSQL?\"\n\"Use MongoDB.\"\nSome of these responses indeed have merit — for example, NoSQL-based database management systems such as MongoDB can certainly be useful when dealing with big data sets. However, contrary to popular belief, MySQL shouldn’t be so quickly ruled out — in some scenarios, MySQL (or MariaDB) might prove to be even better options for big data than their NoSQL counterparts! In this article, we will explore the things you should consider when answering the question: “Is MySQL a good option for my big data project?”",

To understand technical debt, let's compare it with financial debt.\nFinancial debt is an arrangement that gives the borrowing party permission to borrow money under the condition that it is to be paid back at a later date, usually with interest. Financial debt is generally needed due to overspending, lack of financial knowledge, poorly managed budget, etc. to name a few. You might also raise a financial debt to invest in your capital-intensive business, education, etc. which would bring returns in the future. Financial debt is not always a bad thing as long as you're aware of the consequences and always keep it under control.",

It's kind of common practice to either bootstrap or transition the existing applications to containerized or server-less architectures.\nManaging clustered applications can soon become an overhead when the organization scale and hence increases a dire need for a platform that can support automation of all the tasks related to management, deployment, scaling of these clusters.",

Instead of coding software line-by-line by hand, use a low-code tool that provided visual abstractions that enabled developers to shortcut the hand-coding process by dragging and dropping tasks onto workflows, widgets onto screens, and the like.\nThen along came no-code. The contrast between the two approaches was clear. Low-code targeted professional developers, simplifying their work by taking ‘plumbing’ tasks off their plate, while also facilitating collaboration with business stakeholders.",

          "description": "Engineering teams can scale their Kubernetes costs and burn their budget with the same ease by which they scale their infrastructure. Thanks to Kubecost's real-time alerting, the risk of upsetting the finance team can be mitigated. Kubernetes is well-known for its ability to help scale applications rapidly and with ease, but this ability comes with some tradeoffs. Before Kubernetes, teams had to follow a more deliberate procurement approval process to change the capacity allocation. Today, that scaling process has been democratized, and teams can easily scale their clusters up or down.\nWith the ability to create more frequent changes to infrastructure resources come more opportunities to misallocate and over-allocate costly resources. In this model, technical teams can far exceed their expense budget without even realizing it, while financial managers would only notice it after the fact leading to avoidable organizational stress. So, how do you stay on top of your Kubernetes spending if your resources change daily?",

This is dependent on numerous factors including the data pipeline, network, data structure, type of product or solution, short and long-term goals, etc. While there are currently many databases and tools that provide vertical scaling capabilities, there are not many that focus on horizontal scaling -- but there’s still a need for both.\nLatency\nBefore jumping into specific industries that benefit from high-performing, low-latency, geo-distributed databases (it’s a mouthful, I know), let’s define a few terms here. High-performing is pretty self-explanatory so I’ll skip over that one. For the next term, I’ll refer to my colleague Jacob Cohen’s blog on Geo-Distributed Databases. Latency generally measures the duration between an action and a response. In user-facing applications, that can be narrowed down to the delay between when a user makes a request and when the application responds to a request. So, technologies that enable low latency usually improve performance and response times, leading to improved user experience and cost savings.",

          "description": "1. Choice of Programming Language\nThe language depends on the type of cluster. A cluster can comprise of two modes, i.e., Standard and High Concurrency. A High Concurrency cluster supports R, Python, and SQL, whereas a Standard cluster supports Scala, Java, SQL, Python, and R.\nSpark is developed in Scala and is the underlying processing engine of Databricks. Scala performs better than Python and SQL. Hence, for the Standard cluster, Scala is the recommended language for developing Spark jobs.\n2. ADF for Invoking Databricks Notebooks\nEliminate Hardcoding: In certain scenarios, Databricks requires some configuration information related to other Azure services such as storage account name, database server name, etc. The ADF pipeline uses pipeline variables for storing the configuration details. During the Databricks notebook invocation within the ADF pipeline, the configuration details are transferred from pipeline variables to Databricks widget variables, thereby eliminating hardcoding in the Databricks notebooks.\nNotebook Dependencies: It is relatively easier to establish notebook dependencies in ADF than in Databricks itself. In case of failure, debugging a series of notebook invocations in an ADF pipeline is convenient.\n\nCheap: When a Notebook is invoked through ADF, the Ephemeral job cluster pattern is used for processing the spark job because the lifecycle of the cluster is tied to the job lifecycle. These short-life clusters cost lesser than the clusters which are created using the Databricks UI.\n3. Using Widget Variables\nThe configuration details are made accessible to the Databricks code through the widget variables. The configuration data is transferred from pipeline variable to widget variables when the notebook is invoked in the ADF pipeline. During the development phase, to model the behavior of a notebook run by ADF, widget variables are manually created using the following line of code.",

          "description": "When it comes to designing large and complex software systems, microservices architecture is the most common choice nowadays. If you design the microservices architecture in the right way, it certainly becomes a peace of mind. However, if you make some basic mistakes while designing microservices, it becomes a pain of mind in no time. Hence, it is important to not make some basic mistakes in the first place, so as you don't have to rectify and fix them at a later stage when your microservice is already in production and being used by a vast number of consumers.\nIn this article, we will look at one such biggest and most basic mistake you don't want to make with your microservices.",

Let’s Encrypt certificates last 90 days and will need to be renewed after the certificate expires. So I will also provide details to script the renewal in crontab in Docker container.\n1.

          "description": "“It is not necessary to change. Survival is not mandatory.” -W. Edwards Deming Work takes time to flow through an organization and ultimately be deployed to production where it captures value. It’s critical to reduce time-to-production. Software - for many organizations and industries - is a competitive advantage. Organizations break their larger software ambitions into smaller, independently deployable, feature -centric batches of work - microservices. In order to reduce the round-trip between stations of work, organizations collapse or consolidate as much of them as possible and automate the rest; developers and operations beget “devops,” cloud-based services and platforms automate operations work and break down the need for ITIL tickets and change management boards. But velocity, for velocity’s sake, is dangerous. Microservices invite architectural complexity that few are prepared to address. In this talk, we’ll look at how high-performance organizations like Ticketmaster, Alibaba, and Netflix make short work of that complexity with Spring Boot and Spring Cloud. In this workshop we'll look at how to build cloud-native Java systems that are elastic, agile, observable and robust.",

However, enterprise companies that are using multiple EKS, AKS, or GKE cloud Kubernetes clusters for various projects may find it challenging to identify the right level of access for different users, especially when there are multiple users and groups of users who are coming, going, and moving between teams.  \nAs teams expand their usage of Kubernetes, clusters and workloads will exist in different environments. One team may be building their stack on cloud provider “A,” while another team is building a stack on cloud provider “B.” Even on a single public cloud service, clusters may exist in different environments, and IT isn’t even aware of these things. This makes tracking all of the individual logins and permissions across the organization next to impossible, especially when there are multiple accounts and access levels to manage. And the problem only grows in complexity as more people on-board, off-board, or change teams, and projects multiply.",

          "description": "An Overview of Disaggregated Storage\nInfrastructure disaggregation allows organizations to use computing resources more effectively by enabling scalability and flexibility. Disaggregation involves decoupling data center resources of memory, compute and storage, so that each resource can be scaled and provisioned independently. Disaggregation is already widely adopted in cloud computing platforms, with various clouds offering storage systems that are completely independent of compute instances.\nDisaggregated storage is a version of composable disaggregated infrastructure that offers scalable storage by connecting various physical storage devices over a network fabric to form a logical storage pool, in some cases on demand. Disaggregated storage enables the creation of dynamic environments where the compute and storage resources scale elastically based on the application’s workload. Separating storage and compute instances also means that storage can be scaled and managed without interfering with the availability of an application’s services.",

Since it would be impossible to manually go through all of the data and delete the duplicates, companies have come up with machine learning solutions that perform such work for them. Today we would like to take a look at some interesting uses of machine learning to catch duplicates in all kinds of environments. Before we dive right in, let’s take a look at how machine learning systems work.\nHow Do Machine Learning Systems Identify Duplicates?\nWhen a person looks at an image or two strings of data it would be fairly easy for them to determine whether or not the images or strings are duplicates. However, how would you train a machine to spot such duplicates? Perhaps a good starting point would be to identify all of the similarities, but then you would need to explain exactly what 'similar' means. Are there gradations to similarities? In order to overcome such challenges, researchers use string metrics to train machine learning models.",

API Observability itself is an evolution of traditional monitoring and born out of control systems theory.\nTraditional monitoring focuses on tracking known unknowns. This means you already know what to measure like Request Per Second or Errors Per Second. While the metric value may be unknown beforehand, you already know what to measure or probe such as a counter to track requests into buckets.

I had a great experience working with Google Maps API both on the backend and frontend, but it was not without problems and a lot of research. In fact, I did learn a lot and for this very reason, I decided to share some of the most interesting pitfalls that I fell in.\nTo show you what I learned I assembled a small no-brainer application. It is a Spring Boot/Thymeleaf web application with the mission to display on a map the employees from an organization. It can display a particular employee on the map, all the employees on the map, and during the creation of an employee, it allows picking an address from a pinpoint on a map. The features that I decided to implement are for the sake of tutorial purposes and they may not make a lot of sense sometimes. The app can be found here: employee-locator",

Modifying a system in a way that does not allow backward compatibility is called “Breaking Change.” While in the current era of agile software development demands fast-paced implementation of features to cater to rapidly changing requirements, it is extremely necessary to have backward compatibility in the software being developed.\nThis article depicts with an example how Java has achieved backward compatibility while developing new features, which will serve as a potential reference while updating existing code.\nLet us understand the very important concept of 'widening' and how it is retained while developing new features like 'Autoboxing' in Java 5\nWidening\nIn a class that has overloaded methods, one of the compiler's jobs is to determine which method to use whenever it finds an invocation for the overloaded method.",

However, by leveraging Open Source intelligently, you can significantly reduce this cost, by literally having the entirety of GitHub's user base, working for \"free\" for your company. This of course is a bit like what investors refers to as \"China math\", but GitHub has 65 million registered user accounts, most of whom we must assume are developers one way or another. If you intelligently structure your organisation around GitHub, there is literally nothing preventing you from using every single one of these developers as your own company's resource, making you a million times more productive than mega corporations such as Amazon, Facebook, and Microsoft - For a millionth of the cost these mega corporations are paying. But first let's illustrate the problem, such that the solution becomes clear ...\nThe problem\nIn one of my previous jobs somebody had cloned an open source git repository, then added its code to our own private corporate cloud's git repositories, for then to start modifying the thing (the horror!) 2 years later it took one of my developers 6 weeks to update the thing to use the latest version as created by its main developer on GitHub, trying to keep as many of our own customisations as possible in the process. Needless to say, but I was furious about the original decision, due to having responsibilities for code quality at this company.",

Likewise, the monitoring is usually only managed by operators and very little feedback is provided to developers except when they have to fix application bugs (ASAP, of course).

If something is flawed, it affects the whole function. So what are these common slip-ups, and how can you avoid them?\nIt Has a Meaningful Name\nFunctions should have names that describes their purpose or functionality. When a function has a meaningful name, it's easy to read and understand its purpose.\nFor example, if a function's purpose is to find a customer by ID, a good name could be findCustomerById(id: String). It could also just as well be findCustomer(id: String) because the function signature implies that the customer is found by their ID. The word find also implies that the customer might be found or it might not be found.\nIf the function's name would be changed to getCustomer(id: String), its meaning changes because now it implies that there's no fallback; the customer is either found or the function fails miserably and maybe throws an exception.\nBoth are valid names for a function but they have a different meaning and therefore their implementations should also be different.",

This common manifestation of SOA has led some microservice advocates to reject the SOA label entirely”.

Observability, that deep data, is the new fuel for our developer and DevOps engineers.\nThe duality of observability is controllability. Observability is the ability to infer the internal state of a 'machine' from externally exposed signals.

As software development marches towards the cloud, we soon realize that this shift warrants the need to rethink our debugging strategies. This is because as software systems are now leveraging these advancements in cloud computing and distributed systems we see gaps emerging in debugging that cannot be satisfied by the traditional methods of logging and breakpoints.\nFor example, a major issue while using breakpoints is that the codebase needs to be run in debug mode. Therefore, we are not actually replicating the actual state of our systems taking into consideration multi-threading, distributed services, and dependencies on remote services in a cloud-native environment along with multi-service architecture.

Whether we are filling out an online form, sending a text on our phone, or writing an email, it is a fact that many of our business and personal interactions require efficiently written (typed) language. Due to this heavy reliance on electronic communication, it is critical to ensure your online platform has a support system built-in to account for human error; if your application or website allows input or search queries from users, you run the risk of your systems not understanding the text due to spelling errors — and this is where spellcheck comes in.\nWhen you stop and consider how many times you encounter spellcheck in your electronic interactions, it should become clear that it has created a huge failsafe for our often rushed and impatient natures. Spellcheck has come a long way since its beginnings; the first spellcheckers simply verified words instead of suggesting corrections. Fast forward to our current era and spellcheckers have improved in both functionality and efficiency; they operate in the background of our applications and let us know with a red line that we have made a potential error. This is often accomplished with Natural Language Processing (NLP) which, as we have discussed previously, enables computers to process and interpret human language in the form of text or audio data.",

          "description": "Every time I travel to Japan, something that strikes me is how process-driven the Japanese people and culture seem to be. Even something as simple as buying a train ticket is an intricately refined process. The ticket seller first makes sure they have heard and understood you correctly, repeating back your exact request before they print the tickets. And once they’re printed out, they will pick up a pen and check each detail of the ticket — before going through each check again with you. You will be given exact and clear instructions on how to locate the platform and when to expect the train. And you’ll notice that when the train arrives and stops at the platform, the driver also has a checklist they will diligently follow. It’s incredible to observe, but not arbitrary — they do this because they have found it reduces error rates by up to 85% and ensures everything runs smoothly.\nYou might be wondering what Japan has to do with successfully coaching teams, particularly within an Agile framework. And the answer is Shu Ha Ri. This Japanese concept, roughly translated to “first learn, then detach, and finally, transcend” (or more simply: walk, run, fly) is a way of thinking about the stages of learning from beginner to master — and a key philosophy used in the martial art Aikido. Working in an Agile way requires much learning of new rituals, processes, and different ways of thinking, so if you are a scrum master, this concept can be a very useful one for understanding and guiding you in how to be a better team coach and ensuring that each project runs just as smoothly (and to time) as a bullet train.",

          "description": "Frontend developers want to build awesome experiences. Yet they need data from the backends and perform actions against backends. The answer to their problem is APIs. Who builds those APIs? Are they built quickly or are the frontend developers left waiting? Who runs and manages the APIs? After all, the backends do not behave in uniform ways — they speak different languages, emit differently shaped data, have varying authentication requirements, and so on. So running and managing the frontend APIs is not a task to be taken lightly.\nHere are some considerations as you think through the APIs that are the gearbox between the frontend and backends.",

On top of this open source standard, Salesforce developed Lightning Web Components (LWC) as a fast, enterprise-grade wrapper around vanilla web components. The result is a thin, performant, and feature-packed framework built entirely on the open web.",

This included leading development of the Microsoft Orleans framework from its inception at Microsoft Research until it became one of the most successful open-source projects within the .NET ecosystem. Orleans powers a number of large-scale Microsoft systems such as Xbox Game Services, Skype, Azure IoT, Azure ML, Azure Active Directory, and many more cloud services outside Microsoft. So if you’ve ever played online multiplayer games like Halo or Call of Duty, our team built much of the underlying infrastructure that supports it.\nWhen I originally joined Orleans, cloud computing was still in its infancy. We had a 10,000-foot vision and not a single line of actual code. We needed to reimagine how cloud-scale applications should be coded because, at the time, available and high-performance scalable systems were only achievable by experts. And while everyone knew the cloud was coming, we had no idea how to build applications in a way that ensured they would be accessible and productive for millions of software engineers.",

Simply because as developers, our primary objective is often to become better, and as a manager I perceive my primary task to facilitate for that, within an environment where arguably the company's primary objectives, are solved almost as a \"side effect\" of the individual team members' personal objectives are being solved. By aligning the company's incentives with the individuals' incentives, your team members will be able to deliver 100 times more than if these are in opposition with each other.

          "description": "SAFe and Business Architecture. As organizations begin their Lean and Agile journey with SAFe®, SPCs will introduce a tool designed to help organizations determine the best, most logical place to launch their first Agile Release Train (ART). The Value Stream and ART Identification Workshop is designed to help organizations identify the sweet spot where an opportunity to deliver value intersects with a clear problem to solve, leadership support, a clear product or solution, and collaborating teams.\nIt’s challenging to meet the criteria mentioned above, which is why many are tempted to launch ARTs within easier-to-identify constructs such as organizational silos. This rarely works. As we know, value often does not follow the organizational hierarchy. However, it’s important to understand that value stream identification is the first step in an ongoing practice of flow management to optimize the speed of delivery, quality, and customer delight.",

Much like a zip file, they contain other files such as binaries, source code, scripts, and also a manifest that tells users what this project package means. Some common usages of packages are to make it easier to reuse and share code or to deploy code dependencies to different projects. Often, having a formal system with packages can help expose bugs sooner, making it easier to deliver trustworthy software. FlexDeploy packages, along with other built-in continuous integration and delivery functionality, will allow for a significant increase in productivity for developers and release managers.\nIn this blog, we will explore the significance of partial projects, how we can utilize project packages, and also integrating change management into the build and deployment of those packages.",

Research firm Gartner expects the global AI economy to increase from about $1.2 trillion last year to about $3.9 Trillion by 2022, while McKinsey sees it delivering global economic activity of around $13 trillion by 2030. And of course, this transformation is fueled by the powerful Machine Learning (ML) tools and techniques such as Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL), Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN), Gradient-boosted-tree models (GBM), Natural Language Processing (NLP), and more.\nMost of the success in modern AI and ML systems is dependent on their ability to process massive amounts of raw data in a parallel fashion using task-optimized hardware. In fact, the modern resurgence of AI started with the 2012 ImageNet competition where deep-learning algorithms demonstrated an eye-popping increment in the image classification accuracy over their non-deep-learning counterparts (algorithms). However, along with clever programming and mathematical modeling, the use of specialized hardware played a significant role in this early success.",

In response, we are publicly launching a new tool that we’ve used to help teams recently!

As a user, you only need to provide the context of the cluster, i.e. whether it is being used for development, production, or high-availability workloads.

          "description": "When building applications and programs for use by other developers, ensuring you are utilizing valid code identifiers is an important component. These unique identifiers are symbols that have been designated to specific program elements essential to the successful creation of a program, and they can refer to a wide variety of features, including class, namespace, types, variables, and more. To avoid any confusion or misinterpretation, the names given to the symbols should clearly indicate the usage of the corresponding element. The general idea is to create an identity of sorts for the symbol so that it can easily be identified by any individual, not just the original developer.\nDuring the creation of these integral program pieces, it is also important to be conscious of the technical nuances of the applicable programming language; for example, since Java is case sensitive, identifiers that have different cases will be treated differently. As you may know, attempting to navigate the various rules and requirements for code identifiers can take up a lot of time, so we are going to highlight an easy tool you can integrate to do the work for you. The following API can be run in Java to validate input identifiers and analyze for incorrect strokes including usage of whitespace, hyphens, underscores, and other special symbols within the identifier. This is accomplished by configuring input rules for the symbols, such as allowing the identifier “helloWorld” but not \"hello*World\".",

I also have to make sure the DataKeeper Job knows how to create a mirror from SECONDARY to DR in case the SECONDARY or DR server ever become the source of the mirror.

These code snippets, more commonly known as feature flags, allow you to change features (or sub-sections) of your application without re-deploying. They help developers release code faster, with less risk. \nFeature flags are more prevalent than you might believe. At most companies, though, adoption begins at the grassroots level. Developers—usually within a single team, and often just a few individuals—implement a handful of feature flags in an ad hoc way. In these early stages, feature flags aren’t usually being considered at a systemic level. They’re meant to solve specific pain points at specific points in time.

We also hear a lot about Sentiment (which technically is not a separate feature but rather a specialization of the previous two). Finally, we have POS-tagging, which is only occasionally mentioned outside of deeply technical articles for linguists and NLP professionals. \nWe don’t hear much about other NLP capabilities, and this is mainly because often, depending on how an NLP engine is designed, features beyond Categorization and Extraction are not present at all. Specifically, many NLP solutions today are based on Machine Learning algorithms, and ML rarely delivers great accuracy in problems that require both elevated precision and super-fine identification. Then again, some of these capabilities are incredibly useful, in fact sometimes even the only way to address a particular challenge.

Thanks to the rich abstractions Kubernetes provides, deploying software on-premises can be significantly easier than it used to be. Because Kubernetes has achieved such high market penetration (and still growing), it is now a viable target environment for many software products. Nevertheless, Kubernetes requires external tools to be production ready, especially on an on-prem deployment.\nThe purpose of this article is to list tools that everyone should be aware of when it’s time to move an on-prem Kubernetes cluster to production, and by on-prem, we mean not in a cloud environment. In the cloud, it is obviously better to rely on cloud services offered by the provider.",

Thanks to Kubecost's real-time alerting, the risk of upsetting the finance team can be mitigated. Kubernetes is well-known for its ability to help scale applications rapidly and with ease, but this ability comes with some tradeoffs. Before Kubernetes, teams had to follow a more deliberate procurement approval process to change the capacity allocation. Today, that scaling process has been democratized, and teams can easily scale their clusters up or down.\nWith the ability to create more frequent changes to infrastructure resources come more opportunities to misallocate and over-allocate costly resources. In this model, technical teams can far exceed their expense budget without even realizing it, while financial managers would only notice it after the fact leading to avoidable organizational stress.

This is dependent on numerous factors including the data pipeline, network, data structure, type of product or solution, short and long-term goals, etc. While there are currently many databases and tools that provide vertical scaling capabilities, there are not many that focus on horizontal scaling -- but there’s still a need for both.\nLatency\nBefore jumping into specific industries that benefit from high-performing, low-latency, geo-distributed databases (it’s a mouthful, I know), let’s define a few terms here. High-performing is pretty self-explanatory so I’ll skip over that one. For the next term, I’ll refer to my colleague Jacob Cohen’s blog on Geo-Distributed Databases. Latency generally measures the duration between an action and a response. In user-facing applications, that can be narrowed down to the delay between when a user makes a request and when the application responds to a request. So, technologies that enable low latency usually improve performance and response times, leading to improved user experience and cost savings.",

          "description": "1. Choice of Programming Language\nThe language depends on the type of cluster. A cluster can comprise of two modes, i.e., Standard and High Concurrency. A High Concurrency cluster supports R, Python, and SQL, whereas a Standard cluster supports Scala, Java, SQL, Python, and R.\nSpark is developed in Scala and is the underlying processing engine of Databricks. Scala performs better than Python and SQL. Hence, for the Standard cluster, Scala is the recommended language for developing Spark jobs.\n2. ADF for Invoking Databricks Notebooks\nEliminate Hardcoding: In certain scenarios, Databricks requires some configuration information related to other Azure services such as storage account name, database server name, etc. The ADF pipeline uses pipeline variables for storing the configuration details. During the Databricks notebook invocation within the ADF pipeline, the configuration details are transferred from pipeline variables to Databricks widget variables, thereby eliminating hardcoding in the Databricks notebooks.\nNotebook Dependencies: It is relatively easier to establish notebook dependencies in ADF than in Databricks itself. In case of failure, debugging a series of notebook invocations in an ADF pipeline is convenient.\n\nCheap: When a Notebook is invoked through ADF, the Ephemeral job cluster pattern is used for processing the spark job because the lifecycle of the cluster is tied to the job lifecycle. These short-life clusters cost lesser than the clusters which are created using the Databricks UI.\n3. Using Widget Variables\nThe configuration details are made accessible to the Databricks code through the widget variables. The configuration data is transferred from pipeline variable to widget variables when the notebook is invoked in the ADF pipeline. During the development phase, to model the behavior of a notebook run by ADF, widget variables are manually created using the following line of code.",

As a web developer, though, PDFs aren't always the most outstanding experience online:\nViewing experiences vary significantly across different users and devices because they depend on a PDF viewer. Whether it is embedded in web browsers or free online libraries, some viewers are better than others. Adobe Acrobat Reader is generally the universal standard for viewing PDFs properly. Google Chrome is also very common. However, many things have worked in Acrobat that still don't work or render correctly in Chrome.\nIt becomes difficult for me to be able to incorporate PDFs into the rest of my website. Most often, PDFs would prompt users to download PDFs on their devices.\nConverting PDFs to HTML is complicated and unreliable. If I want to present content inside a webpage that is in PDF format, I might often flatten it to PDF to make it easier to embed.\nI have no visibility into how my visitor is viewing those PDFs. This means that I have no idea if someone is reading certain pages, how long they spend on those pages, etc.\nFortunately, Adobe PDF Embed is an excellent solution to solve all of these challenges.",

This is especially true when it comes to addressing concerns around diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI).\nThat’s why our host, Federico Toledo, wraps up season three of Quality Sense with an illuminating interview with a leader in the DEI space. Ash Coleman has had a very unique and interesting career path that has led her to her current role as the Head of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion at Credit Karma.

Edwards Deming Work takes time to flow through an organization and ultimately be deployed to production where it captures value. It’s critical to reduce time-to-production. Software - for many organizations and industries - is a competitive advantage. Organizations break their larger software ambitions into smaller, independently deployable, feature -centric batches of work - microservices. In order to reduce the round-trip between stations of work, organizations collapse or consolidate as much of them as possible and automate the rest; developers and operations beget “devops,” cloud-based services and platforms automate operations work and break down the need for ITIL tickets and change management boards. But velocity, for velocity’s sake, is dangerous. Microservices invite architectural complexity that few are prepared to address. In this talk, we’ll look at how high-performance organizations like Ticketmaster, Alibaba, and Netflix make short work of that complexity with Spring Boot and Spring Cloud.

It does sound simple until you know that ‘efficiently’ is an ocean of complexities and beyond the expertise of most businesses. Capturing and orchestrating data is a rough path but a necessity to undo data silos and provide immediate results to on-demand search queries. And that is why we need data orchestration that is purposefully meant to enable quick access and yet protect it from widespread fragmentation.\nHow Does Big Data Orchestration Work? \nOrchestration tools are a middleware layer between the data warehouse (source points) and the business applications such as CRM, BI Analytics, etc. Through pre-built connectors and API adapters, these tools perform rapid integration of all source points with the main silos. It simplifies data monitoring from a single point while enabling the teams to perform seamless fetching. All of this is achieved without having to develop custom scripts or devoting additional resources.",

Data generation is happening from everywhere starting from social media sites, various sensors, satellites, purchase transactions, Mobile, GPS signals, and much more. With the advancement of technology, there is no sign of the slowing down of data generation, instead, it will grow in a massive volume.

In many companies, there are multiple teams working on smaller parts of a big project-and these teams are spread all over the world. It's challenging to tell who is doing what and when, where the blockers are and what kind of waste has delayed the process. Without a reliable set of data points to track across teams, it's virtually impossible to see how each piece of the application development process puzzle fits together. DORA metrics can help shed light on how your teams are performing in DevOps.\nWhat Are DORA Metrics?\nWell, these metrics didn't just come out of thin air. DORA metrics are a result of six years' worth of surveys conducted by the DORA (DevOps Research and Assessments) team, that, among other data points, specifically measure deployment frequency (DF), mean lead time for changes (MLT), mean time to recover (MTTR) and change failure rate (CFR). These metrics serve as a guide to how well the engineering teams are performing and how successful a company is at DevOps, ranging from \"low performers\" to \"elite performers.\" They help answer the question: Are we better at DevOps now than we were a year ago?",

This approach has the following downsides:\nThe sealed secret is encrypted with its own random asymmetric key that is specific to the sealed secret name and namespace and therefore copy-pasting the encrypted data for another secret or in another namespace won't work.\nSecondly, by default, SealedSecrets generated for a cluster won't work with another cluster because the installation of Bitnami Controller creates a new pair of public/private keys. This makes the overall GitOps implementation approach cumbersome. \nOne solution may be to export and import the same set of keys from one cluster to another. However, if the key on a cluster gets compromised, it would grant access to all sealed secrets on all clusters with the same key pair.",

          "description": "Looking for a way to jazz up your websites or applications? Creating compelling imagery to accompany your copywriting, service offerings, and projects can be an excellent method for ramping up your content. One type of imagery that has become incredibly popular, especially during the digital age, is the composite image. A composite image is made up of two or more images, which are merged together to create a single composition. The resulting composite image often depicts people or objects in implausible, improbable, or impossible circumstances, such as a 21st-century man in an 18th-century city, or a castle in the clouds. Another slightly more practical application of the technique is to integrate photos of landscapes or backgrounds with lighting or other visual aspects that are generally technically or physically unachievable.\nWhile this technique may sound relatively uncomplicated in our current technology-driven world, it was a different story when the composite image was first created in the mid-1800s. Artists and photographers began toying with the layering effect by literally cutting, gluing, and juxtaposing photos and paintings together to market and memorialize large social events. As society moved into the World War I era, the process utilized the virtual reality effect to create scenes of soldiers with their loved ones, as well as propaganda for the war effort.",

Namely, I will use Akka HTTP and Streams to create a REST API capable of streaming a video file, in mp4 format, in a way that matches the expectations of HTML5 <video> tag. Besides, I will also add a few words about Akka and some components like Akka Streams to give you some theoretical background before you start coding. But first, one question.\nWhy Video Streaming?\nThere are three main reasons behind choosing video streaming as the topic for today’s article. The first one is that it is an absorbing and complex subject for me, especially on a large scale (like Netflix) and I have always wanted to learn more about it. The next reason is that it is a niche topic, so a project based around video streaming can be a great addition to anyone's portfolio - this one is especially important for people who want to start their journey with Scala and Akka.

          "description": "Object-Oriented Programming and Design principles have now existed for over 50 years, so it seems odd that apparently, no one has noticed the substantial flaw in Object-Oriented Design that has existed since the very beginning. We are instead told that Object-Oriented (OO) Design principals have won the day, as they provide a programmatic mirror image of the real-world scenarios they are intended to reflect. If we look a little deeper, OO Design is in fact completely detached from the world that it is intended to model. Whilst it is obviously true that the world consists of objects — known and unknown, real and abstract — the unimaginable flaw in OO Design fundamentals that seems to remain undetected until this day is that calling objects can never have complete mastery of the Interfaces of the objects they call: objects can only ever be masters of their own Interface — of themselves.\nExample\nLet’s imagine a Customer Object in negotiations with a SalesContact Object, in any given IT Landscape. OO Design asks us to pretend that the Customer Object has perfect mastery of the SalesContact Object Interface, and therefore knows exactly how to call the relevant RequestQuotation method of the SalesContact Object: having already guessed at the name of that method, its latest publicly-available version, and based upon the false hope that the definition of the RequestQuotation method will not change over time. The obvious reality is that the Customer Object can only guess at the Interface of the SalesContact Object, and hope that this Interface does not change in the short-term (e.g. as the product range offered by the SalesContact becomes more developed, and therefore more complex). Add to this the fact that the very same Customer Object may need to exchange with several different SalesContact Objects in several different departments, not all using the same Interface Version or even the same Interface — the same API — and we must consider that the OO Design philosophy, as it stands today, is massively flawed.",

Integrated Azure Synapse Workspace helps handle security and protection of data in one place for all data lake, data analytics, and warehousing needs, but also requires learning some new concepts.

The portal is available on the public Internet using Azure AD Access controls for controlling access to any Synapse Analytics instance in any tenant that we have access to. However, Synapse Analytics introduces a new way to connect to the portal from Internet-isolated, on-premises networks, and offices using Private Link Hubs. Compared to Private Links that protect access to services and databases, this solution is used for routing traffic to a web portal.

Let's probe the Kubernetes magic that makes the beautiful CPU and memory dials tick on the monitoring dashboards.\nKubernetes has a built-in Metrics API (see spec) and a simple CLI query, kubectl top ( documentation), that you can use to fetch a snapshot of the CPU and memory consumption of a Kubernetes object. The Kubernetes Metrics API is dependent on the Metrics Server cluster add-on that gathers resource usage from the Kubelets of the cluster. The primary consumer of the Metrics API is the Horizontal Pod Autoscaler. The Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) uses the metrics served by the Metrics API to scale the number of pods based on the observed resource metrics values. Apart from the Metrics API, HPA is designed to also consume metrics from your application running on the cluster (custom metrics) and services outside the cluster (external metrics) to autoscale pods. Some examples of external metrics provider to HPA are the popular open-source events-based autoscaling service KEDA and soon Logic Monitor. Similar to HPA, Vertical Pod Autoscaler (VPA) relies on Metrics Server as well. VPA allows you to automatically scale the CPU and memory constraints of the containers in a pod.",

          "description": "In this blog post, we will discuss how you can create a minimalistic raw Ubuntu image using Packer and then deploy it on a bare-metal server using the provisioning engine, Tinkerbell.\nWhat is Packer?\nPacker by HashiCorp is an awesome tool to create pre-configured machine images which can be directly used to create an instance. This should not be seen as a replacement for other configuration tools like Ansible, Chef, etc. Instead, you can use the same tools to pre-configure your image, and with Packer, you can automate the management of your machine images like pushing to an image repository or ensuring your CI pipelines have updated images. Packer also helps you to create parallel builds, i.e you can create multiple images for different platforms using a single template. This enables you to ensure changes in your applications can be tested on multiple platforms simultaneously. It can also be seen as a factor to reduce the parity between developer and production builds.",

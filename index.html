              <div class="details-content">
                <p>Currently, most software teams that are using Azure DevOps to build their software choose to use Azure-hosted agents as their build server. This comes with a lot of benefits. Many libraries are already installed on these agents so it's quite compatible with most projects' specifications. For every build, you get a new agent that is provisioned and after the build will be destroyed. However, this has its own limitations. Azure Hosted Agents are using a specific type of VM so it is not possible to increase ha…</p>

                <p>Multi-writer replication has been a challenge in the MySQL ecosystem for years before truly dedicated solutions were introduced – first Galera (and so Percona XtradDB Cluster (PXC)) replication (around 2011), and then Group Replication (first GA in 2016).
Now, with both multi-writer technologies available, do we still need traditional asynchronous replication, set up in active-active topology? Apparently yes, there are still valid use cases. And you may need it not only when for some reason Galera/PXC or GR…</p>

Managed Services
There are multiple ways to use Kafka in the cloud. One way is to use IBM’s managed&nbsp;Event Streams service or Red Hat’s managed service&nbsp;OpenShift Streams for Apache Kafka. The big advantage of managed services is that you don’t have to worry about managing, operating, and maintaining the messaging systems.

Imagine, for example, we have an application that is using raw TCP sockets to communicate with another process. Raw TCP sockets are fast, but they have various problems. For example, all data is sent in plain text over the network and without authentication (if we don’t implement a protocol).
One solution is to use HTTPS connections instead. We can also authenticate those requests with an Authenti…</p>

                <p>For the last few years, you have heard the terms "data integration" and "data management" dozens of times. Your business may already invest in these practices, but are you benefitting from this data gathering?&nbsp;
Too often, companies hire specialists, collect data from many sources and analyze it for no clear purpose. And without a clear purpose, all your efforts are in vain. You can take in more customer information than all your competitors and still fail to make practical use of it. &nbsp;</p>

                <p>In this tweet, I was asked if I had a list of resources for developers who are new to Java. I didn't at the time, but I've spent some time researching, and here is that list.
I've listed content that is both free and paid. It's not that one type is superior; it’s just to give you plenty of choices. These are the resources that I've used and do still use to re-learn Java. So, if you're new to Java or looking to pick it up again after a break, this blog is for you.</p>

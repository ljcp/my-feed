                    <span>An Overview of Disaggregated Storage
Infrastructure disaggregation allows organizations to use computing resources more effectively by enabling scalability and flexibility. Disaggregation involves decoupling data center resources of memory, compute and storage, so that each resource can be scaled and provisioned independently. Disaggregation is already widely adopted in cloud computing platforms, with various clouds offering storage systems that are completely independent of compute instances.
Disaggregated storage is a version of composable disaggregated infrastructure that offers scalable storage by connecting various physical storage devices over a network fabric to form a logical storage pool, in some cases on demand. Disaggregated storage enables the creation of dynamic environments where the compute and storage resources scale elastically based on the application’s workload. Separating storage and compute instances also means that storage can be scaled and managed without interfering with the availability of an application’s services.</span>

                    <span>Java Messaging Service
JMS or Java Messaging service is a solution for asynchronous communication using messages (objects). Initially, it was part of JSR (specification used in Java EE).
Simple Problem as Example to Explain: User Creation Service
Let&#x27;s assume we have any service that can process only 100 requests per second. Any higher load will freeze service or put it down.</span>

                    <span>The internet of things (IoT) remains a popular subset of the information technology (IT) realm. However, despite its advancements, IoT is still in its infancy. By 2027, the global IoT market is estimated to be worth over $1,463.19 billion USD. 
With massive leaps in IoT technology and a rapidly changing landscape, IoT security is a budding concern. Here&#x27;s what you need to know about IoT security.</span>

                    <span>As companies collect more and more data about their customers, an increased amount of duplicate information starts appearing in the data as well, causing a lot of confusion among internal teams. Since it would be impossible to manually go through all of the data and delete the duplicates, companies have come up with machine learning solutions that perform such work for them. Today we would like to take a look at some interesting uses of machine learning to catch duplicates in all kinds of environments. Before we dive right in, let’s take a look at how machine learning systems work.
How Do Machine Learning Systems Identify Duplicates?
When a person looks at an image or two strings of data it would be fairly easy for them to determine whether or not the images or strings are duplicates. However, how would you train a machine to spot such duplicates? Perhaps a good starting point would be to identify all of the similarities, but then you would need to explain exactly what &#x27;similar&#x27; means. Are there gradations to similarities? In order to overcome such challenges, researchers use string metrics to train machine learning models.</span>

                    <span>I’ve worked on websites for several years, both professionally and for side projects. One day, I reflected on the fact that all of my web development education had come from actually making websites. In most cases, I’d have a specific problem, Google how to solve it and learn something new in the process.
I wondered what I was missing by never learning HTML in a comprehensive way. Forget CSS and JavaScript. I’m just talking about raw HTML. It might seem silly to go back to such a basic aspect of web development after a decent amount of experience, but it’s easy to become overconfident with a skill just because you know enough to do a few useful things.</span>

Additionally, when during testing your application – there are testing scenarios that require multiple permutations/combinations of input data in your application, then you might have to think of using a test automation tool for automating them.</span>

This blog discusses the importance of hybrid multicloud to accelerate business transformation. 
The discussion assumes that the readers are well versed with cloud technology concepts as well as the business value and challenges related to modernizing applications using cloud technologies.
This blog focuses only on the concept of multicloud, which adds new dimensions of complexity and value as opposed to leveraging a single cloud provider.
Evolution of Hybrid Multicloud
The evolution of cloud computing started with the utility computing concept. It began from the concept of dedicated resources vs. shared resource platforms. Businesses have embraced cloud platforms including private, public, hybrid, and hybrid multicloud.
In a simple term, a hybrid multicloud is the use of hybrid cloud and multicloud models as depicted in diagram 1.</span>

                    <span>API Observability is a key component to properly execute APIOps Cycles and ensure your building something of value for your API users. If you’re not familiar with APIOps Cycles, take a look at this guide which provides an agile framework to quickly build APIs that are business-oriented and serve customer needs. API Observability itself is an evolution of traditional monitoring and born out of control systems theory.
Traditional monitoring focuses on tracking known unknowns. This means you already know what to measure like Request Per Second or Errors Per Second. While the metric value may be unknown beforehand, you already know what to measure or probe such as a counter to track requests into buckets. This makes it possible to report on the health of a system (like Red, Yellow, Green), but is a bad tool for troubleshooting engineering or business issues which usually require asking arbitrary questions.</span>

I had a great experience working with Google Maps API both on the backend and frontend, but it was not without problems and a lot of research. In fact, I did learn a lot and for this very reason, I decided to share some of the most interesting pitfalls that I fell in.
To show you what I learned I assembled a small no-brainer application. It is a Spring Boot/Thymeleaf web application with the mission to display on a map the employees from an organization. It can display a particular employee on the map, all the employees on the map, and during the creation of an employee, it allows picking an address from a pinpoint on a map. The features that I decided to implement are for the sake of tutorial purposes and they may not make a lot of sense sometimes. The app can be found here: employee-locator</span>

                    <span>Introduction
As a full-stack developer who often takes on DevOps and infrastructure responsibilities, the following happens all too frequently.

                    <span>Backward compatibility 
Backward compatibility is a property of a system, product, or technology that allows for integration with an older legacy system or with an input designed for such a system. Modifying a system in a way that does not allow backward compatibility is called “Breaking Change.” While in the current era of agile software development demands fast-paced implementation of features to cater to rapidly changing requirements, it is extremely necessary to have backward compatibility in the software being developed.
This article depicts with an example how Java has achieved backward compatibility while developing new features, which will serve as a potential reference while updating existing code.
Let us understand the very important concept of &#x27;widening&#x27; and how it is retained while developing new features like &#x27;Autoboxing&#x27; in Java 5
Widening
In a class that has overloaded methods, one of the compiler&#x27;s jobs is to determine which method to use whenever it finds an invocation for the overloaded method.</span>

                    <span>In most companies the single largest cost is human resources. However, by leveraging Open Source intelligently, you can significantly reduce this cost, by literally having the entirety of GitHub&#x27;s user base, working for &quot;free&quot; for your company. This of course is a bit like what investors refers to as &quot;China math&quot;, but GitHub has 65 million registered user accounts, most of whom we must assume are developers one way or another. If you intelligently structure your organisation around GitHub, there is literally nothing preventing you from using every single one of these developers as your own company&#x27;s resource, making you a million times more productive than mega corporations such as Amazon, Facebook, and Microsoft - For a millionth of the cost these mega corporations are paying. But first let&#x27;s illustrate the problem, such that the solution becomes clear ...
The problem
In one of my previous jobs somebody had cloned an open source git repository, then added its code to our own private corporate cloud&#x27;s git repositories, for then to start modifying the thing (the horror!) 2 years later it took one of my developers 6 weeks to update the thing to use the latest version as created by its main developer on GitHub, trying to keep as many of our own customisations as possible in the process. Needless to say, but I was furious about the original decision, due to having responsibilities for code quality at this company.</span>

                    <span>Remember the 90s? Pokémon, Beanie Babies, Crazy Bones, Super Nintendo, Pogs, and neon windbreakers... Those were the good old days. The web was a simpler place too, with barebones websites composed of mostly text and hyperlinks. I remember it like it was yesterday. Or, wait – 30 years ago?
I recently found Wicked Coolkit – a nifty retro-themed toolkit – and I thought it would be fun to play around with it to briefly relive those years. The toolkit includes a hit counter, webrings, and developer trading cards.</span>

                    <span>In most organizations, developers are not allowed to access the production environment for stability, security, or regulatory reasons. This is a quite good practice (enforced by many frameworks like COBIT or ITIL) to restrict access to production but a major drawback is a mental distance created between developers and the real world. Likewise, the monitoring is usually only managed by operators and very little feedback is provided to developers except when they have to fix application bugs (ASAP, of course). As a matter of fact, most developers have very little idea of what a real production environment looks like and, more important, of the non-functional requirements allowing to write production-proof code.
Involving developers into resolving production issues is a good thing for two main reasons:</span>

                    <span>Artificial intelligence is becoming more prominent in all major operating systems, including the Android operating system. It is increasingly being used for new purposes, including device security since it can detect and stop threats. Although artificial intelligence is used for cybersecurity threat detection and mitigation, it also poses a risk as hackers utilize it as well.
This trend is rapidly gaining momentum and is part of the reason ransomware attacks increased 150% last year. DevOps developers working on new cybersecurity algorithms must learn to reverse engineer the applications hackers develop with AI to create more robust defenses. Malware has become very sophisticated due to advances in artificial intelligence, making it more complex for users and companies to detect or prevent.</span>

                    <span>There’s no one-size-fits-all approach regarding application monitoring, especially for companies using applications in various cloud environments. Companies are rapidly investing in microservices, mobile apps, data science programs, data ops, etc. Subsequently, they’re also integrating monitoring tools to improve domain-centric monitoring abilities.
AIOps tools help streamline the use of monitoring applications. It allows companies that need high application services to efficiently manage the complexities of IT workflows and monitoring tools. AIOps extends machine learning and automation abilities to IT operations. These robust technologies aim to detect vulnerabilities and issues to resolve them, determine operational trends, and simplify the remediation of the problems that affect their applications’ performance and availability.</span>

1. Introduction
Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) is one of the most popular AWS services. It allows you to create cloud computing instances in no time. You have the choice out of predefined templates (AMI) for several Operating Systems. Pricing is dependent on what kind of purpose the instance needs to serve. Whether you want to have an instance continuously running, or only at a scheduled interval, or you need bare metal, or a dedicated instance, etc. Many options are available for different purposes. Besides that, a lot of different configurations are available to choose from. You will need to choose the right one for your application. In the Free Tier, you only use the micro instance. All of this information is available at the Amazon website and therefore only links to these pages are provided. The offerings may change and you should refer to the Amazon website for the details.</span>

We see bitcoin mining, credit card credential stealing, injecting malicious code into the systems, stealing confidential data, etc. In today&#x27;s digital world, it is not just about having speed, reaching your customers quickly, easy setup, mind-blowing features, etc., but rather, it is about how safe or secure your systems, data, or features are.
What is Cybersecurity?
The approach and practice of securing electronic data, networks, computer systems, and any form of digital infrastructure from malicious attacks is known as Cybersecurity. Banks, educational institutions, tech companies, government agencies, publishing media houses, hospitals, and every sector invest in cybersecurity infrastructure to protect their customer data, secrets, and business intelligence from attackers.</span>

                    <span>Preface
Designing a MySQL database schema is an inevitable part of the career of every MySQL database administrator or even a developer. Developers and MySQL database administrators usually turn to the schema design side of MySQL to improve query performance, normalize their databases, add or drop certain indexes, modify columns, also for other things.
Generally, what one database administrator considers to be a &quot;good&quot; database design might not seem so perfect for another DBA. Everyone has their own set of preferences—depending on experience and other things—but in general, even while MySQL does move forward at a rapid pace, with improvements being made left and right, MySQL schema design practices do not change much.</span>

For example, a pizza order is useless when its maximum wait time is passed. The customer might have considered ordering from another shop. Also, in a highly dynamic environment like stock trading, a BUY order must be processed within seconds. If not, the order will be irrelevant as the prices can fluctuate.</span>

                    <span>If you watch much TV or read much fiction, you are likely familiar with some typical character archetypes. First, there is the kid who does everything by the book and does well in school. Second, is the character that builds a business by testing the limits and getting the job done while still coloring in the lines. Third, the wild child character throws all of the pieces of a problem in the air to see how and where they will land.
When it comes to project management, there are three main types, just like the characters mentioned earlier. Waterfall is the cautious and rule-abiding kid. Agile is the businessman testing the speed limits to get a product out quickly. Finally, cowboy is the rule-breaker who just wants to get the job done without overthinking the rules they may be breaking.</span>

Let&#x27;s say you&#x27;re a Perl developer distraught at the continued decline in usage and mindshare of your favorite language.
You know that you do good work and that your tools and techniques are sound, but the world outside of Perl-specific forums, software archives, social media groups, and regards it as antiquated, out-of-date, or worse, that IT epithet legacy.

                    <span>In our previous blog posts (1, 2), we explored how query optimizers may consider different equivalent plans to find the best execution path. But what does it mean for the plan to be the &quot;best&quot; in the first place? In this blog post, we will discuss what a plan cost is and how it can be used to drive optimizer decisions.
Example
Consider the following query:</span>

                    <span>What makes a good function or method? It&#x27;s not just one thing, but rather a combination of things where each is significant. If something is flawed, it affects the whole function. So what are these common slip-ups, and how can you avoid them?
It Has a Meaningful Name
Functions should have names that describes their purpose or functionality. When a function has a meaningful name, it&#x27;s easy to read and understand its purpose.
For example, if a function&#x27;s purpose is to find a customer by ID, a good name could be findCustomerById(id: String). It could also just as well be findCustomer(id: String) because the function signature implies that the customer is found by their ID. The word find also implies that the customer might be found or it might not be found.
If the function&#x27;s name would be changed to getCustomer(id: String), its meaning changes because now it implies that there&#x27;s no fallback; the customer is either found or the function fails miserably and maybe throws an exception.
Both are valid names for a function but they have a different meaning and therefore their implementations should also be different.</span>

                    <span>JPA is the standard that guides the developer towards an object conceptualization of his application and provides him with an abstraction of the relational model. However, once the model is in place, several frameworks are available to generate the request or the command. Which choices are the most relevant? Let&#x27;s explore.
Criteria JPA2
Once your dependencies are added, the Criteria API is immediately available. It is the most basic and requires knowing the API and its subtleties to produce requests. The use of these objects obliges to pass directly in character string the name of the attributes in order to impose restrictions. Errors are therefore quite frequent during development and during refactoring operations. Plus, because these errors happen at run time, they are often caught too late.</span>

                    <span>In recent times, cloud computing has evolved as a crucial solution, providing businesses a potentially cost-efficient model for easing their computing requirements and accomplishing their business objectives. However, there are few threats like security that continue to challenge this evolving technology. Here’s a sneak peek into the common challenges faced by cloud customers.
Reliability
Reliability is one of the most common challenges faced by cloud customers, and it all comes down to choosing a cloud provider that is proven and established. Customers need to understand the Service Level Agreement (SLA) as few providers assure a 100% rate of network uptime and refund customers for any downtime.</span>

                    <span>Over the last few blog posts, I&#x27;ve covered critical elements of developer tooling for Kubernetes and how things are looking in 2021. As we continue to dive into that discussion, we must not forget the process of building container images.
Of course, most of us create our images by writing Dockerfiles and building them with the Docker engine. And yet, more and more teams are adopting newer alternatives. After all, the Docker image format has been standardized as part of the OCI (Open Container Initiative) a long while ago.</span>

                    <span>The rising popularity of serverless development alongside the increased adoption of multi- and hybrid-cloud architectures has created a lot of competition among platforms. This gives developers many choices about where they can run functions on serverless platforms—from public managed services to on-premises Kubernetes.
If you&#x27;ve read my previous articles about Java serverless, you learned how to get started developing Java serverless functions with Quarkus and how those serverless functions can be optimized to run on Kubernetes. So what should you do next to make your serverless functions fit better with the many choices available to you?</span>

                    <span>Usually, when “unused” comes up in conversation regarding CSS, it’s about removing chunks of CSS that are not used in your site or, at least, the styles not currently in use on a specific page. The minimal amount of CSS …

                    <span>App development stacks have been improving so rapidly and effectively that today there are a number of easy, straightforward paths to push code to production, on the cloud platform of your choice. But what use are applications without the data that users interact with? Persistent data is such an indispensable piece of the IT puzzle that it’s perhaps the reason the other pieces even exist. 
Enter cloud and internet scale requirements, essentially mandating that back-end services must be independently scalable / modular subsystems to succeed. Traditionally, this requirement has been difficult in the extreme for stateful systems. No doubt, database as-a-service (DBaaS) has made provisioning, operations, and security easier.

A graph is made up of nodes, sometimes called vertices, and edges. The nodes of a graph typically represent a person, place, or thing and are drawn using a circle. Edges represent relationships between nodes and are drawn as a line between the two nodes.&quot;,&quot;tablet&quot;:&quot;&quot;}},&quot;slug&quot;:&quot;et_pb_text&quot;}&quot; data-et-multi-view-load-tablet-hidden&#x3D;&quot;true&quot;&gt;

                    <span>Microservices architecture offers various advantages over Monolithic Architecture, some of which are listed below:
Loosely coupled architecture.
Easy to scale based on demand.
Small individual services based on business functionality.
The technology stack of each microservice can be different.
However, when transforming from a traditional monolithic architecture to microservices, the common bottleneck is performance. According to Perforce Developer (Perforce Survey) Survey:</span>

Now, we can check easily in a live environment, determine if some particular index will be helpful or not, and figure out how we get to know which index to test. This requires an in-depth knowledge of indexing and, also, experience in Postgresql. But, in PostgreSQL, we can get an automatic recommendation of indexes for specific queries by using three extensions hypog, pg_stat_statements, and pg_qualstats. 
Now, let’s move directly to the practical part of how we can use this feature in Postgres.</span>

                    <span>SOA vs Microservices
Should you happen to be researching &quot;Service-Oriented Architecture&quot; (SOA) on the Internet today, the latest articles you are likely to find will typically be titled: &quot;SOA vs microservices&quot;. Complicating the battle somewhat is that you will also find respected industry experts, such as Martin Fowler, stating that some “consider microservices to be one form of SOA, perhaps service orientation done right”.
Martin goes on to declare: “The problem…is that SOA means too many different things and that most of the time we come across something called &#x27;SOA&#x27; [there is]…a focus on ESBs (Enterprise Service Buses) used to integrate monolithic applications. This common manifestation of SOA has led some microservice advocates to reject the SOA label entirely”. As such, for the remainder of this article, I will assume the use of ESB middleware as a fundamental characteristic of SOA landscapes, as well as representing the most fundamental distinction there is between SOA and REST.</span>

                    <span>On one hand, we have a wire-led machine made up of circuits and algorithms. On the other hand exists a human being led by complex emotions and hormones that are triggered by chemical reactions in the brain. These two don’t seem like a match, do they? However, when it comes to creating a hybrid of the two, the two seemingly contradictory concepts — psychology and artificial intelligence — complement each other perfectly.
Artificial Intelligence
Artificial Intelligence, or AI, refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think like humans and mimic their actions. The term is also applied to any machine that demonstrates traits associated with a natural human mind such as learning, critical thinking, and problem-solving.</span>

                    <span>This tutorial demonstrates the ability to recover from accidental truncate or table drop.
Motivation
This scenario came out of a real-world situation where I got paged in the early hours of the day by a contractor evaluating our product on behalf of a customer. The contractor was in panic and concerned that she&#x27;d just lost four days worth of work by executing an older version of her application which included a hardcoded TRUNCATE statement. There was no backup available either. We were faced with a situation where we were going to miss customer timeline and lose the precious time reloading the data. We are talking about a multi-TB dataset. Once I had some coffee and we huddled to disucss next steps, we agreed the best next option is to leverage CockroachDB capability where dropped data does not leave the filesystem until garbage collection is complete, which by default is set to 25hours and luckily for us, that property was not changed in the cluster. Needless to say, we were able to recover the lost data following the procedure below.</span>

Cypress and Selenium are leading the market as the most widely used options, but there’s also Appium for mobile app testing, Puppeteer for automating tasks in Chrome, and Protractor for Angular and AngularJS applications, just to name a few.
Recently a newcomer has joined the pack: TestProject, a free, open-source test automation platform for e2e testing that helps simplify web, mobile, and API testing. The TestProject SDK has language support for Java, C#, Python, and, most recently, JavaScript.</span>

As the Red Hat Summit site explains to us, this &quot;...event is expanding to become an all-new, flexible conference series, consisting of a 2‑part immersive virtual experience as well as a global tour of small-scale, in-person* events. This series will create collective opportunities to share experiences, innovations, and insights.&quot;</span>

                    <span>In most cases, you aren’t the only person working on the same project or codebase. That means that other people get to read your code and have to understand it. That’s also true for the code comments you leave behind. Developers often write ‘quick and dirty’ comments without much context, leaving other developers clueless about what you’re trying to say. It’s a bad practice that creates only more confusion than clarifies things.
So, yes - you should be bothered with writing meaningful code comments to help other developers. A code comment that describes the function, the reasoning behind the function, and its input and output will speed up the learning process of other developers. Especially for junior developers, this information comes in handy when learning the code.</span>

In this part, we&#x27;re going to take the architecture we cooked up in the last part, and see if we can&#x27;t get it running in containers, using nothing but Docker itself.

They might be discussing it in the context of improving velocity, code churn, code refactoring, or it might just be an item on a very long to-do list that never gets prioritised. We put out a call out for real-world experiences of what helps when it comes to reducing technical debt and received a huge number of responses from devs across a variety of sectors. In the previous article, developers told us about their technical debt horror stories. Here’s what they had to say about how to manage and prevent it:
1. Treat Technological Debt as a Tool Rather Than a Scourge
“Technical debt, like financial debt, is more likely to become an issue if you ignore it or act as if it doesn&#x27;t exist. Instead, accept it and regard it as a method that needs constant attention and maintenance.</span>

For example, says Devadas, insurance companies use hyperautomation to process numerous documents to settle claims. Because of hyperautomation, he says, artificial intelligence (AI)-powered tools can read and extract data at super-human speed from documents, chat, and other channels.  Which allows claims to be processed faster and more accurately than ever before.</span>

If not planned and executed correctly this goal can quickly become a distant dream.
As the name suggests, in-sprint automation is automating and developing the user story in the same sprint. Easier said than done. The team will need to overcome several challenges before getting to this state.</span>

                    <span>It’s not a leap to propose that Terraform is the DevOps cornerstone for Infrastructure as Code (IaC). Terraform’s adoption since its mid-2014 release to the software development landscape has been meteoric. More than 8000 organizations are using Terraform for infrastructure automation.
To successfully use the IAC tool, it’s important to optimize HashiCorp Configuration Language (HCL). HCL has become one of the most popular languages on GitHub. Typically though, it’s preferable to work with a familiar programming language rather than learning a new one. The good news here is that the Terraform community, in collaboration with AWS Cloud Development Kit (CDK), recently announced the support of TypeScript and Python for provisioning infrastructure using Terraform. Developers can leverage these languages to optimize the IaC’s tools for many providers and modules.</span>

                    <span>If you have a public-facing web application, the odds are you should probably be thinking about load testing. Any tester can (and should) add load testing to their repertoire.
Functional tests are often carried out with a single user’s experience of your application in mind, but what happens when hundreds or thousands of users are on your site at the same time? Load testing helps prepare an application for this eventuality by simulating that situation before the application goes live. That way, you have time to fix any issues you find, and there are no nasty surprises in production.</span>

                    <span>Query optimization is an expensive process that needs to explore multiple alternative ways to execute the query. The query optimization problem is NP-hard, and the number of possible plans grows exponentially with the query’s complexity. For example, a typical TPC-H query may have up to several thousand possible join orders, 2–3 algorithms per join, a couple of access methods per table, some filter/aggregate pushdown alternatives, etc. Combined, this could quickly explode the search space to millions of alternative plans.
This blog post will discuss memoization — an important technique that allows cost-based optimizers to consider billions of alternative plans in a reasonable time.</span>

                    <span>Finding the right custom software development company that delivers is a complex challenge. It is like hiring a crew to build your new house. Triple check with whom you will work with over the next few months or years as it has a direct impact on your success or failure. As we know at the heart of every successful organization is a quality custom software solution, therefore we decided to create a guide with key factors on how to choose a custom software development company that delivers.
Key Factors to Take Into Account When Choosing a Custom Software Development Company That Delivers
1. Review Portfolios
Explore the prospective software development company’s previous projects. Picking a company with a proven experience in a specific industry, technology, or type of project can be advantageous as they are familiar with the challenges that can occur during a custom software development life cycle for a specific product or feature. When reviewing portfolios, also consider the size of your project. You’ll notice if any custom software development company prefers working with certain-sized projects.</span>

As a result, a productive yet cheap workforce is one of the reasons why many businesses are considering outsourcing their software. And before making any decision, let’s see how outsourcing benefits you and what all the bad sides are when it comes to this activity.</span>

                    <span>There are plenty of failure possibilities with Scrum. Given that Scrum is a framework with a reasonable yet short “manual,” this effect should not surprise anyone. When Scrum becomes an element of an agile transformation, the following three common essential agile failure patterns prove to be an exceptionally tough nut to crack for any Scrum Master.
Join me and explore the consequences of foreseeable failure patterns and what you can do about them in a little more than seven minutes.</span>

                    <span>Our new mantra for managing and maintaining the health and functionality of our apps and environments is observability. Observability is the quality of software, services, platforms, or products that allows us to understand how systems are behaving. Without the new sources of data giving us insights, our modern cloud-native applications would be quite a challenge to monitor. Observability, that deep data, is the new fuel for our developer and DevOps engineers.
The duality of observability is controllability. Observability is the ability to infer the internal state of a &#x27;machine&#x27; from externally exposed signals. Controllability is the ability to control input to direct the internal state to the desired outcome. While driving, observing a red stoplight means controlling our vehicle by pressing the breaks (or in some modern vehicles, having the brakes applied automatically for us).</span>

                    <span>Following the lingering promise of managed infrastructure, reduced operational cost, and resiliency, cloud computing has seen phenomenal trends in adoption since the past decade. As software development marches towards the cloud, we soon realize that this shift warrants the need to rethink our debugging strategies. This is because as software systems are now leveraging these advancements in cloud computing and distributed systems we see gaps emerging in debugging that cannot be satisfied by the traditional methods of logging and breakpoints.
For example, a major issue while using breakpoints is that the codebase needs to be run in debug mode. Therefore, we are not actually replicating the actual state of our systems taking into consideration multi-threading, distributed services, and dependencies on remote services in a cloud-native environment along with multi-service architecture. Similarly, logs offer no respite, as they may be cumbersome and even costly to execute and store.</span>

                    <span>A couple of years ago I wrote an article here creating so much fuzz I felt as if I had been cursing in a church. The idea of the article was that you could teach yourself DDD or Domain Driven Design in 5 minutes. In this article I will revisit DDD with an example use case, illustrating not only how you can learn (the most important parts of) DDD in 5 minutes, but also throw in Micro Services for fun - While at the same time giving you an enterprise grade chat module backend, you can build a frontend on top of yourself, and throw in CQRS for laughs at the end. But first watch the video.
Linguistic definition
Did you notice how easy it was for me to show you and talk about the core concepts of the chat module&#x27;s backend in the video? That is because as an integrated part of my development and design phase I declared a language. This is what is called a bounded context in DDD. By declaring what words and phrases implies from within the context of my chat module&#x27;s backend, communicating about what it does becomes easier. Below you can see my definitions.</span>

                    <span>Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) have come a long way, both in terms of adoption across the broader technology landscape and the insurance industry specifically. That being said, there is still much more territory to cover, helping integral employees like claims adjusters do their jobs better, faster, and easier.
Data science is currently being used to uncover insights that claims representatives claim wouldn&#x27;t be available otherwise, and which can be extremely valuable. Data science steps in to identify patterns within massive amounts of data that are too large for humans to comprehend on their own; machines can alert users to relevant, actionable insights that improve claim outcomes and facilitate operational efficiency.</span>

                    <span>Preface
I was recently playing around with Spring Data Elasticsearch (the Spring Data project for Elasticsearch) and came across several issues. One of these was a lack of up-to-date articles. This led me to share my experience using the latest Elasticsearch 7 and Spring Data Elasticsearch 4.1. I hope that my advice can help others gain insight into the tool and how to effectively use it for a variety of reasons.
In this Article, You Will Learn
What Elasticsearch and Spring Data Elasticsearch are.
Basic Elasticsearch cluster setup via Docker (including management and monitoring tool).
How to configure Spring Data Elasticsearch in a project.
How to use Spring Data Elasticsearch to upload and access Elasticsearch data.
What are some pitfalls related to Elasticsearch usage?
First, I will briefly explain the purpose of Elasticsearch.</span>

Meanwhile, now not many developers are not familiar with such events and how to prepare for them. In this article, I&#x27;ll explain what tools can simplify your development process as well as increase your chance to win.
What&#x27;s A Hackathon?
The idea of a hackathon is to deliver an application that has to solve one of the problems in a given field within 24/48h. Often competition organizers notify participants about the hackathon subject. So in most of the cases process has the next steps:</span>

Introduction to SQL Query and Data Management
Standard Query Language, or SQL for short, allows users access to databases using specific commands or queries, allowing them to change and maintain them. Commands such as SELECT — which helps users extract the data from the database — UPDATE, DELETE, INSERT INTO, and many more, make data management easier for database administrators.
Each of these commands has its own set of functionalities that are useful when working with databases. A few SQL IDEs, such as Arctype, offer developers the ideal framework for visualizing, designing, modeling, and managing their databases. Arctype is a free, collaborative, and intuitive SQL editor to simplify all your data management and visualization requirements.</span>

Just like monitoring our applications, it is very much necessary to monitor our database system. We want to monitor things substantially more granular than system-level processes — things such as:
How many queries actually make use of the index?
How effective is the database cache?
The number of open connections.
And so on.</span>

Previous Experiences with Kubernetes
In all honesty, exactly a year ago I knew nothing about Kubernetes - it wasn&#x27;t because I had never worked with it, but that I wasn&#x27;t even clear about the concept of &quot;container&quot;. It&#x27;s true that this last year I&#x27;ve been working with this tool frequently (which undoubtedly helped me when preparing for the exam), but I think you need no more than a little previous experience.</span>

                    <span>We have all heard about the pessimist who gives up easily and the optimist who perseveres in the face of failures. When faced with adversity, most people feel indecisive, restless, and anxious about the future.
It is what happens afterward that makes a difference — an optimist is briefly disturbed by the experience but soon bounces back while a pessimist continues to be paralyzed by fear of failure. Optimist storms out of this phase to believe that it’s only a rough patch, while the pessimist spirals into hopelessness with the belief in the permanent nature of their situation.</span>

                    <span>Every programmer comes across Multithreading and for some reason, it has been considered hard to understand. Well, it&#x27;s not. In this blog, we will go through some basics of multithreading and in the process will try to understand why it is such an important topic in software development.
A program can have multiple processes and Multithreading allows us to run these multiple processing units concurrently. Our programs by default run on a Single thread also known as the main thread. Multithreading is useful because:</span>

                    <span>Real-time beats slow data in most use cases across industries. The rise of event-driven architectures and data in motion powered by Apache Kafka enables enterprises to build real-time infrastructure and applications. This blog post explores why the Kafka API became the de facto standard API for event streaming like Amazon S3 for object storage, and the tradeoffs of these standards and corresponding frameworks, products, and cloud services.

                    <span>Before OOP languages, the programmer would control how the program is executed and that would be from the app’s main routine. In modern programming, that control is delegated to the external non-main loops, and the main routine becomes an event-loop that waits for events to occur and then executes it with the relevant event handler.
This new model of programming (it has been around since the 70s though) is called event-driven programming.</span>

                    <span>In our technology-driven world, electronic communication is increasingly overshadowing verbal communication. Whether we are filling out an online form, sending a text on our phone, or writing an email, it is a fact that many of our business and personal interactions require efficiently written (typed) language. Due to this heavy reliance on electronic communication, it is critical to ensure your online platform has a support system built-in to account for human error; if your application or website allows input or search queries from users, you run the risk of your systems not understanding the text due to spelling errors — and this is where spellcheck comes in.
When you stop and consider how many times you encounter spellcheck in your electronic interactions, it should become clear that it has created a huge failsafe for our often rushed and impatient natures. Spellcheck has come a long way since its beginnings; the first spellcheckers simply verified words instead of suggesting corrections. Fast forward to our current era and spellcheckers have improved in both functionality and efficiency; they operate in the background of our applications and let us know with a red line that we have made a potential error. This is often accomplished with Natural Language Processing (NLP) which, as we have discussed previously, enables computers to process and interpret human language in the form of text or audio data.</span>

                    <span>Motivation
CockroachDB is a cloud-native SQL database for building global, scalable cloud services that survive disasters. It makes building geo-distributed databases easy. Ability to anchor data to geographic localities is a unique capability of CockroachDB. Today, I will demonstrate this ability to extend beyond regions, availability zones, nodes, data centers and racks. The architecture allows us to domicile data to specific storage devices using storage attributes.
High-Level Steps
Start a CockroachDB cluster with multiple disks per node using storage attributes
Create a table pinned to a specific disk type
Create another table and verify its location on disk
Evict the second table to demonstrate granularity
Assign proper storage constraints deterministically
Verify Setup

                    <span>A web filtering appliance is an internet content filter that obstructs web-borne threats such as malware, ransomware, and phishing from impacting a database. It also allows network administrators control over what online content can be viewed by network users. Therefore, as well as keeping networks and the devices that link to them safe from viruses, a web filtering appliance can also help enhance productivity in the workplace.
Every time a network user visits a link or enters a URL into a browser bar, the web filtering appliance compares the request to open a web page against blacklists of websites and IP addresses. The blacklists are kept up to date with details of websites and IP addresses known to store malware or linked with spam emails, spam emails being a high-risk vector for phishing attacks.</span>

For this first-of-its-kind report, Tricentis interviewed quality leaders at one hundred Fortune 500 (or global equivalent) organizations and major government agencies across the Americas, Europe, and Asia-Pacific.
Although there is no shortage of reports on overall software testing trends, the state of testing at the organizational level—particularly at “household name” brands—has historically been a black box. On the one hand, large organizations often have access to resources far beyond the reach of smaller businesses (for example, commercial as well as open-source software, access to consultants and services, etc.). But on the other hand, they face daunting challenges such as:</span>

Technology is ever-evolving, and we have seen a major shift in application platforms from on-premise to cloud and containerization, application architecture from monolithic to micro-service, and many more. Organizations today are working towards making the operations an easy task and reducing the cost, as it is one of the painful areas where the project spends a lot of time and effort to streamline the entire process. Jenkins X is one of the platforms which has such kind of capability.

                    <span>In one of my projects, I was looking for some simple options to manage MongoDB database schema changes similar to other projects like Flyway or Liquibase. I found Mongock, which is an open-source Java MongoDB tool.
Prerequisites
Spring Boot 2.5.0
Maven 3.6.1
JAVA 11
Mongo 4.4
Getting Started
We will start by creating a simple Spring Boot project from start.spring.io, with the following dependencies: Web, MongoDB, and Lombok.</span>

                    <span>Every time I travel to Japan, something that strikes me is how process-driven the Japanese people and culture seem to be. Even something as simple as buying a train ticket is an intricately refined process. The ticket seller first makes sure they have heard and understood you correctly, repeating back your exact request before they print the tickets. And once they’re printed out, they will pick up a pen and check each detail of the ticket — before going through each check again with you. You will be given exact and clear instructions on how to locate the platform and when to expect the train. And you’ll notice that when the train arrives and stops at the platform, the driver also has a checklist they will diligently follow. It’s incredible to observe, but not arbitrary — they do this because they have found it reduces error rates by up to 85% and ensures everything runs smoothly.
You might be wondering what Japan has to do with successfully coaching teams, particularly within an Agile framework. And the answer is Shu Ha Ri. This Japanese concept, roughly translated to “first learn, then detach, and finally, transcend” (or more simply: walk, run, fly) is a way of thinking about the stages of learning from beginner to master — and a key philosophy used in the martial art Aikido. Working in an Agile way requires much learning of new rituals, processes, and different ways of thinking, so if you are a scrum master, this concept can be a very useful one for understanding and guiding you in how to be a better team coach and ensuring that each project runs just as smoothly (and to time) as a bullet train.</span>

                    <span>Frontend developers want to build awesome experiences. Yet they need data from the backends and perform actions against backends. The answer to their problem is APIs. Who builds those APIs? Are they built quickly or are the frontend developers left waiting? Who runs and manages the APIs? After all, the backends do not behave in uniform ways — they speak different languages, emit differently shaped data, have varying authentication requirements, and so on. So running and managing the frontend APIs is not a task to be taken lightly.
Here are some considerations as you think through the APIs that are the gearbox between the frontend and backends.</span>

Are you having problems realizing the speed and agility promised by continuous delivery (CD)? Does continually delivering new code seem impossible to you? Feature flags might be the tool you&#x27;re missing. Without them, implementing CD is difficult. With feature flags, it&#x27;s not just easier; it&#x27;s better.</span>

                    <span>Nic Raboy remembers the challenge of database management from his experience at a previous employer that ultimately led him to a career as Senior Developer Advocate at MongoDB. &quot;Every time we had to scale, which was about once a year, we had to throw more money at servers to make them more powerful. Not only that, but you had to actually shut down the database to scale it up. We&#x27;d have to worry about backups and making sure that things don&#x27;t go south during the process.&quot;
MongoDB helps solve many of the pain points of database management by delivering a distributed database platform built for the cloud era. Millions of developers around the world use MongoDB to power companies with massive troves of data to manage, such as Google, SAP, eBay, Sega and EA.</span>

                    <span>Introduction
We’ve all been there when we have to manually redline our designs so developers know exactly what our perfect designs are actually showing; we have even tried sending over source files for our devs to use when implementing. But isn’t there a better way of sending over detailed design information? 
There are ways we can make markups easier and a way of disseminating this information quicker and more efficiently. This is of the utmost importance; if a developer doesn’t have all the information in front of them they will not spend precious time digging around for important information, a good handoff is a detailed project with information to hand or directly on top of the designs for quick implementation.</span>

                    <span>As awesome as flexbox is, what it’s doing under the hood is actually a little strange because, by default, it is doing two things at once. It first looks at the content size which is what we would get if by declaring width: max-content on an element. But on top of that, flex-shrink is also doing some work allowing the items to be smaller, but only if needed.
Let’s break those two down and see how they work together.

                    <span>What is SAML 2.0?
At its core, Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) 2.0 is a means to exchange authorization and authentication information between services. SAML is frequently used to implement internal corporate single sign-on (SSO) solutions where the user logs into a service that acts as the single source of identity which then grants access to a subset of other internal services.
The advantage of adopting SAML/SSO from a security perspective is clear:</span>

                    <span>A faster startup and smaller memory footprint always matter in Kubernetes due to the expense of running thousands of application pods and the cost savings of doing it with fewer worker nodes and other resources. Memory is more important than throughput on containerized microservices on Kubernetes because:
It&#x27;s more expensive due to permanence (unlike CPU cycles)
Microservices multiply the overhead cost
One monolith application becomes N microservices (e.g., 20 microservices ≈ 20GB)
This significantly impacts serverless function development and the Java deployment model. This is because many enterprise developers chose alternatives such as Go, Python, and Nodejs to overcome the performance bottleneck—until now, thanks to Quarkus, a new Kubernetes-native Java stack. This article explains how to optimize Java performance to run serverless functions on Kubernetes using Quarkus.</span>

                    <span>Project Context
This year a number of financial services firms have had to comply with a new &quot;401(k)-to-IRA Rollover Advice&quot; fiduciary rule. This rule mandates that wealth managers and broker-dealers must demonstrate &quot;investor&#x27;s best interest&quot; intent when presenting investment opportunities to their clients.
Many financial services firms with legacy and 3rd party SaaS application landscape face a common challenge of data lineage and data consistency throughout the client onboarding user journey. Throughout this journey, the client’s investment profile is used to put together a proposed investment portfolio and open an investment account.</span>

                    <span>In the B4X developing suite, B4J is used to develop desktop apps based on JavaFX or server apps based on Jetty. By default, it cannot be used to create web applications without a server. A third-party library, BANano, makes this possible. It can transpile everything you write in B4J to Javascript, HTML, and CSS. The project can run purely in the browser.
Dynamsoft Barcode Reader is written in C++. It provides a JavaScript version that uses WebAssembly. The barcode decoding can be done on the client-side which is a good match for BANano.</span>

All these and more questions are what devs face every day in their work trying to create products that serve users.
Here at Setapp, we are facing these exact questions (we offer users 210+ apps in a single subscription). This is why this year, for the first time ever, we conveyed a survey of user preferences in Mac apps. In this first-of-its-kind survey, we asked users about their preferences and app choices. I’d like to share these findings to help devs have a better understanding of user preferences and needs.</span>

This part of the project was the first hardware build of the project. I have now built and deployed a complete outdoor weather station to gather data about current weather conditions outside the greenhouse. This will allow me to compare conditions inside the greenhouse with conditions outside the greenhouse, and compensate accordingly.</span>

                    <span>Any web service needs to export their public API if consumers want to make the best use of that service. A developer-friendly approach to do so if you work in the Java ecosystem is to package DTOs and endpoint interfaces in an API jar file and use the Retrofit framework to create type-safe clients for integration testing. This article discusses a complete example.
If you’ve worked in enterprise Java projects you will remember good old Web Services Description Language, the XML based format for describing network services by IBM and Microsoft. Maybe you still work with it? WSDL and its twin XML Schema are among those W3C standards that seasoned developers love to hate. Its specification files are not very human readable, let alone human writable. Fortunately you don&#x27;t have to. They can be generated by your server endpoint and fed straight into a code generator to create transfer objects (DTOs) and service stubs.</span>

                    <span>PGBouncer is a lightweight connection pooler for PostgreSQL. CockroachDB is a cloud-native SQL database for building global, scalable cloud services that survive disasters.
CockroachDB is a PostgreSQL wire compatible database, which means it aims to have tight compatibility with the PG ecosystem. Today, we&#x27;re going to wire PGBouncer to work with CockroachDB. This article is meant to scratch the surface of possibilities unblocked by PGBouncer with CockroachDB and not meant to be an in-depth overview. We&#x27;re currently researching this topic and will follow up with official docs on the proper architecture and sizing of PGBouncer and CockroachDB.</span>

                    <span>It&#x27;s safe to say that every modern web application these days relies to some degree on three foundational web standards: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. While HTML has largely stabilized since the HTML5 standard, both CSS and JavaScript continue to evolve to meet developers&#x27; and users&#x27; needs.
The evolving nature of these three technologies has lead to the introduction of web components, a cross-browser solution for building complex web apps. On top of this open source standard, Salesforce developed Lightning Web Components (LWC) as a fast, enterprise-grade wrapper around vanilla web components. The result is a thin, performant, and feature-packed framework built entirely on the open web.</span>

                    <span>Introduction
I left Microsoft after 19 years, where I led teams that built system software for highly scalable cloud applications. This included leading development of the Microsoft Orleans framework from its inception at Microsoft Research until it became one of the most successful open-source projects within the .NET ecosystem. Orleans powers a number of large-scale Microsoft systems such as Xbox Game Services, Skype, Azure IoT, Azure ML, Azure Active Directory, and many more cloud services outside Microsoft. So if you’ve ever played online multiplayer games like Halo or Call of Duty, our team built much of the underlying infrastructure that supports it.
When I originally joined Orleans, cloud computing was still in its infancy. We had a 10,000-foot vision and not a single line of actual code. We needed to reimagine how cloud-scale applications should be coded because, at the time, available and high-performance scalable systems were only achievable by experts. And while everyone knew the cloud was coming, we had no idea how to build applications in a way that ensured they would be accessible and productive for millions of software engineers.</span>

                    <span>Assuming you&#x27;re working in an environment where you have to communicate and collaborate with others, avoiding micro management starts out with the architecture of whatever you want to build. I was once asked how I would go ahead of leading a software development department, and my answer was; &quot;Well, first of all, I consider everybody to be a lead developer one way or another.&quot;
The above is a crucial mindset to facilitate for autonomy. Simply because as developers, our primary objective is often to become better, and as a manager I perceive my primary task to facilitate for that, within an environment where arguably the company&#x27;s primary objectives, are solved almost as a &quot;side effect&quot; of the individual team members&#x27; personal objectives are being solved. By aligning the company&#x27;s incentives with the individuals&#x27; incentives, your team members will be able to deliver 100 times more than if these are in opposition with each other. After a while, it becomes like &quot;gravity&quot;. Self sustained software development departments, with such momentum, that for the uninitiated it seems to be like a force of nature, you couldn&#x27;t stop even if you tried!</span>

                    <span>Choosing the best technology for web development is a fundamental pillar for every business. But the process becomes sucking when you have to choose between the leading technologies like AngularJS, React JS, and Vue.js. All three differ only by their release date and their features.
From startups to ISVs, all are confused about choosing the right technology for their project. Be it Angular, React, or Vue.js, all have created a lot of buzz in the market and enjoy excellent community support.</span>

In July 2019, Capital One became aware of a data breach inside their Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud infrastructure. A security researcher found social media posts describing the attack, and after investigating the breach, the company discovered that the attacker was able to steal the personal information of approximately 100 million individuals in the United States and 6 million in Canada.</span>

Legacy Java applications are difficult to modernize. Enterprises rely on these monolithic apps to power their businesses but face an urgent mandate to move to the cloud and adopt a cloud native architecture. The following sections track the process of refactoring the Medrec application (also known as the Avitek Medical Records application), a monolithic WebLogic sample Java EE application, into microservices and deploying the new microservices on Oracle Container Engine for Kubernetes (OKE).

There&#x27;s a list of items which consist of people, cats, and a dog. Each item has a name and type. On top there are filters for the name and type.

                    <span>In this post, I’m going to show you how to set up and run your very own private, dedicated Minecraft server in the cloud. I have blogged about this before, but the server was limited to 1 CPU core and 1 GB of RAM in that post. In this post, we&#x27;re going to create a server with up to 4 CPU cores and 24 GB of RAM! That’s more than enough resources to host a game with 20+ friends with excellent performance (and still have enough leftover to create another server for something else). And best of all, it’s absolutely free! Forever!! I’m sure you’re just as excited as I am about this, so let’s jump right into it and get started!
Why Is This a Big Deal? 
In this post, we’re going to launch a new OCI Virtual Machine that uses a new Ampere Arm chip. These VMs provide better price-performance and near-linear scaling for CPU-bound workloads compared to x86-based instances. They are suitable for a wide range of workloads including web applications, media encoding, AI Inferencing, and much more. We’re very proud that Oracle is now partnering with leading technology vendors to make Arm server-side development first-class and easy.</span>

                    <span>User feedback is vital to the success of our projects. It can help us identify which new ideas we should pursue as we develop and can keep us focused on delivering just what users need.
Minimum Viable Feedback (MVF)
We have all seen projects that didn’t have the right user validation and feedback. We know this information is important, but getting it, and using it effectively, can be difficult. This can be especially problematic with new projects where you can get into that tricky phase of being slightly ahead of where the users are. It may be tempting to wait to proceed based on user feedback, but that leads to a “chicken or egg” scenario. The faster you can provide meaningful improvements, the greater the adoption, which means greater feedback.</span>

While declarative infrastructure, programmatic deployments, and repeatable automation are desirable, they aren’t capable of resolving or preventing incidents in every major infrastructure. Even using Kubernetes to restart containers can only solve a certain class of issues. There are still problems for operator teams tasked to hold things together until the next version reaches production.</span>

                    <span>Introduction
In the previous post of this series &quot;AWS Application Deployment Basics,&quot; we set up a PostgreSQL database and then we connect to it via a NodeJS application.
However, the Nodejs application is running on the same machine and database access is local for it. It is a totally valid setup and because it is on the same machine, the access is straightforward. But, having applications and databases running on separate machines is also a very common setup and we will cover that path as well later in this series. But today, we will focus mostly on the web server we want to run on an EC2 instance in the public subnet.</span>

                    <span>There are some qualities that differentiate average from high performing software development companies and attitude towards the software architecture culture is one of them.
Software Architecture Culture
The culture is better and the results are much better in teams where software developers and architects pay particular attention to software architecture quality. In teams where it’s all about delivering tickets as quickly as possible, the culture and results are poorer. It is proven! However, it is very important to highlight that where there is too much focus on software architecture and not enough on delivery is hugely counter-productive as well. Both valuing software architecture and striving for continuous delivery are critical.</span>

                    <span>How the Security Industry Fell a Decade Behind the Broader Tech Industry
I’m not going to sugarcoat it; the security industry has fallen way behind the broader tech industry in the last decade in a really fundamental way. While much of the tech industry has started to pivot away from hardware and software-based solutions – which dominated the 90s and early 2000s – and towards the use of API-first SaaS services, most of the security industry has not.
Now, this reluctance to embrace a new way of delivering security outcomes means that customers are overburdened with acquiring, deploying, and managing security tools in a legacy model. A painful, not to mention expensive, way to defend against threats.</span>

                    <span>SAFe and Business Architecture. As organizations begin their Lean and Agile journey with SAFe®, SPCs will introduce a tool designed to help organizations determine the best, most logical place to launch their first Agile Release Train (ART). The Value Stream and ART Identification Workshop is designed to help organizations identify the sweet spot where an opportunity to deliver value intersects with a clear problem to solve, leadership support, a clear product or solution, and collaborating teams.
It’s challenging to meet the criteria mentioned above, which is why many are tempted to launch ARTs within easier-to-identify constructs such as organizational silos. This rarely works. As we know, value often does not follow the organizational hierarchy. However, it’s important to understand that value stream identification is the first step in an ongoing practice of flow management to optimize the speed of delivery, quality, and customer delight.</span>

                    <span>For a long time software development processes have been using packages. A package, for all intents and purposes, is a container file. Much like a zip file, they contain other files such as binaries, source code, scripts, and also a manifest that tells users what this project package means. Some common usages of packages are to make it easier to reuse and share code or to deploy code dependencies to different projects. Often, having a formal system with packages can help expose bugs sooner, making it easier to deliver trustworthy software. FlexDeploy packages, along with other built-in continuous integration and delivery functionality, will allow for a significant increase in productivity for developers and release managers.
In this blog, we will explore the significance of partial projects, how we can utilize project packages, and also integrating change management into the build and deployment of those packages.</span>

                    <span>GPUs Continue to Expand Application Use in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning
Artificial intelligence (AI) is set to transform global productivity, working patterns, and lifestyles and create enormous wealth. Research firm Gartner expects the global AI economy to increase from about $1.2 trillion last year to about $3.9 Trillion by 2022, while McKinsey sees it delivering global economic activity of around $13 trillion by 2030. And of course, this transformation is fueled by the powerful Machine Learning (ML) tools and techniques such as Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL), Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN), Gradient-boosted-tree models (GBM), Natural Language Processing (NLP), and more.
Most of the success in modern AI and ML systems is dependent on their ability to process massive amounts of raw data in a parallel fashion using task-optimized hardware. In fact, the modern resurgence of AI started with the 2012 ImageNet competition where deep-learning algorithms demonstrated an eye-popping increment in the image classification accuracy over their non-deep-learning counterparts (algorithms). However, along with clever programming and mathematical modeling, the use of specialized hardware played a significant role in this early success.</span>

                    <span>When starting with gRPC there are many resources setting out what gRPC is, where it originated from and how to create basic service and client. All those tutorials do a very good job in helping the developers to get started using gRPC in their projects. We can find materials talking about gRPC server, stub client, interceptors, protobuf, encrypted connection, load balancing but hardly we find all this together and prepared for a real production scenario. Deployments to production are not discussed and available resources are sparse.
There are some projects that provide a collection of handy features that can help you to set up gRPC communication in a reliable way but they are all generic building blocks without an initial structure that you can evolve from.</span>

                    <span>One of the most impactful ways to reduce spend on Kubernetes infrastructure is to make sure your clusters are optimally sized for the workloads they run. Working with many teams over the past year we have seen that it’s not so obvious how to arrive at an optimally-sized cluster, even in autoscaling environments. In response, we are publicly launching a new tool that we’ve used to help teams recently! While implementing this solution with users so far we’ve seen savings in the range of 25-60%, even having a major impact in autoscaling environments.
How It WorksPermalink
This new tool generates context-aware cluster sizing recommendations after analyzing Kubernetes metrics on historical workloads and cloud billing data. As a user, you only need to provide the context of the cluster, i.e. whether it is being used for development, production, or high-availability workloads. We then recommend cluster configurations, which optimize for the respective balance of cost, simplicity, and performance/headroom. Because this solution is Kubernetes native, we consider the following when providing recommendations:</span>

“Doesn’t DevOps use that guy Jenkins to monitor something called technical debt so that we can have a cleaner Git, which somehow allows our Kubernetes to Docker? All I know is that our operations people don’t like it when we release on demand, and our annual software releases just deliver last year’s trends too late.”</span>

                    <span>Humans have been in the business of engineering since the beginning of our existence. Software engineering hasn’t been around for very long in this context; however, our collective learning about the process has increased exponentially nevertheless. The tools and technology behind everything from source code to computing machines have evolved rapidly. One static, fundamental principle will continue to shape the tech economy and how future businesses will run. This series discusses how the Modularity Principle will force all of us to find a specialty and perfect its network API.
Complex Systems
All systems are simply a sum of their parts. When I see someone look at a monstrous problem and become flustered, they’re usually flustered because they don’t even know where to begin. Other times, they know where to start, but they balk at the amount of time they perceive it takes to solve the problem. This balking is a valid defense mechanism that prevents us from wasting our time on things that do not matter to us.</span>

                    <span>Does it ever cross your mind that praise can be negative? I guess not. After all, it looks harmless and seems to be quite effective. Conventional wisdom says that if you praise people, they are motivated to do better.


 
People who have been praised throughout their life by their well-meaning parents, friends, and teachers for their talent and smartness or those who have experienced extreme focus on talent and smartness throughout their childhood learn to value only intelligence. No wonder when these people enter the workforce, they continue to seek approval and demand praise every step of the way.


 
Every opportunity is a measure of their intelligence — do I look smart, how will I be judged, what if others find my ideas dumb. With a single-minded focus on validating themselves, all the…</span>

                    <span>Plagiarism is the term given to the borrowing of someone else’s ideas and passing them around as one’s own. It exists in academia, in professional work environments, and any other field where there’s a creation of some kind of content involved.
It’s considered a serious offense, leading to copyright laws, fines, and even imprisonment (in some severe cases). Today, there are software and other special practices implemented to keep plagiarism in check.</span>

Augmented reality is already becoming more commonplace by the day. Via smartphones, AR is already widely accessible throughout the world of gaming, entertainment, and even finance-based consumer applications. In terms of business, cloud access means that AR users can operate seemingly free from hardware while applications enable businesses to link the data-driven power of the computer with human judgment and expertise. 
It’s this collaboration between rich data and human intervention that makes AR an ideal asset in the world of fintech. The sector is growing while augmented reality represents the next logical step in making finance run on brand new tech.</span>

                    <span>Overview
Git Flow is an abstract idea of a Git workflow. It helps with continuous software development and implementing DevOps practices. The Git Flow Workflow defines a strict branching model designed around the project release. This provides a robust framework for managing larger projects.  
Git Flow is ideally suited for projects that have a scheduled release cycle and for the DevOps best practice of continuous delivery. It assigns very specific roles to different branches and defines how and when they should interact. It uses individual branches for preparing, maintaining, and recording releases.</span>

                    <span>The serverless Java journey started out with functions—small snippets of code running on demand. This phase didn&#x27;t last long. Although functions based on virtual machine architecture in the 1.0 phase made this paradigm very popular, as the graphic below shows, there were limits around execution time, protocols, and poor local-development experience.
Developers then realized that they could apply the same serverless traits and benefits to microservices and Linux containers. This launched the 1.5 phase, where some serverless containers completely abstracted Kubernetes, delivering the serverless experience through Knative or another abstraction layer that sits on top of it.</span>

                    <span>Kubernetes is much more than a runtime platform for Docker containers. Through its API not only can you create custom clients, but you can also extend Kubernetes. Those custom Controllers are called Operators and work with application-specific custom resource definitions. Not only can you write those Kubernetes operators in Go, but you can also do this in Java. Within this talk, you will be guided through setting up and your first explorations of the Kubernetes API within a plain Java program. We explore the concepts of resource listeners, programmatic creation of deployments and services, and how this can be used for your custom requirements.</span>

                    <span>When building applications and programs for use by other developers, ensuring you are utilizing valid code identifiers is an important component. These unique identifiers are symbols that have been designated to specific program elements essential to the successful creation of a program, and they can refer to a wide variety of features, including class, namespace, types, variables, and more. To avoid any confusion or misinterpretation, the names given to the symbols should clearly indicate the usage of the corresponding element. The general idea is to create an identity of sorts for the symbol so that it can easily be identified by any individual, not just the original developer.
During the creation of these integral program pieces, it is also important to be conscious of the technical nuances of the applicable programming language; for example, since Java is case sensitive, identifiers that have different cases will be treated differently. As you may know, attempting to navigate the various rules and requirements for code identifiers can take up a lot of time, so we are going to highlight an easy tool you can integrate to do the work for you. The following API can be run in Java to validate input identifiers and analyze for incorrect strokes including usage of whitespace, hyphens, underscores, and other special symbols within the identifier. This is accomplished by configuring input rules for the symbols, such as allowing the identifier “helloWorld” but not &quot;hello*World&quot;.</span>

Automation is the key to improving efficiency, reducing human error and reducing operating costs. Repetitive work will require fewer workers, and more employees will focus on strategic decision-making and creative problem solving.

2. The 2 Types of Automation Technology
Robotic Process Automation (RPA)
Business process automation (often referred to as business process management or BPM)
In general, low-code automation capabilities can more prompt companies that rely on repetitive processes to evaluate how to improve efficiency.

DZone Dev of the Month - Mir Ali

From DZone Editor Samantha Ross: &quot;Mir Ali (DZone profile) never fails to bring the fire and wisdom to his beautifully worded articles. His focus this May was on Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC), but since he started only this past December, he&#x27;s shared his knowledge on everything from AI to DevOps. Both his published pieces this month I classed as phenomenally well-written, and I&#x27;d like to congratulate Mir on his growing DZone portfolio and engagement, having hit his 100k this month. Looking forward to what&#x27;s next!&quot;</span>

To meet these requirements, many deploy multiple instances of their applications and services across multiple cloud regions. This legacy approach leaves room for downtime and, even worse, inconsistencies in data.  

In this Refcard, we explore patterns and anti-patterns to multi-region database deployments — allowing your applications to survive a region failure without downtime while also ensuring consistent and low latency access to data no matter where you do business.</span>

                    <span>I often help people automate the configuration of their infrastructure so they can build 3-node clusters that span Availability Zones and Regions. The CLI for creating a DataKeeper Job and associated mirrors that contain more than one target can be a little confusing, so I&#x27;m documenting it here in case you find yourself looking for this information. The DataKeeper documentation describes this as a Mirror with Multiple Targets.
The environment in this example looks like this:
PRIMARY (10.0.2.100) - in AZ1
SECONDARY (10.0.3.100) - in AZ2
DR (10.0.1.10) - in a different Region
I want to create a synchronous mirror from PRIMARY to SECONDARY and an asynchronous mirror from PRIMARY to DR. I also have to make sure the DataKeeper Job knows how to create a mirror from SECONDARY to DR in case the SECONDARY or DR server ever become the source of the mirror. EMCMD will be used to create this multiple target mirror.
We need to first create the Job that contains all this possible endpoints and define whether the mirror will be Sync (S) or Async (A) between those endpoints.</span>

                    <span>The following is the first in a series of posts related to feature flags across CI/CD.
 
Continuous integration (CI) and feature flags look like a match made in heaven. Integrating code regularly, combined with the ability to isolate new features and turn them on and off at will, means you can move fast and still manage risk.
But with great power comes great responsibility. Feature flags require careful planning and continuous management, just like your builds do.</span>

                    <span>For quite a while now, developers have used snippets of code to turn features on and off during runtime. These code snippets, more commonly known as feature flags, allow you to change features (or sub-sections) of your application without re-deploying. They help developers release code faster, with less risk. 
Feature flags are more prevalent than you might believe. At most companies, though, adoption begins at the grassroots level. Developers—usually within a single team, and often just a few individuals—implement a handful of feature flags in an ad hoc way. In these early stages, feature flags aren’t usually being considered at a systemic level. They’re meant to solve specific pain points at specific points in time. There is no formal program in place, and there are no plans to manage flags across teams.</span>

                    <span>Route53 is an AWS service that provides a mapping between domain names and IP addresses. At first glance, this could lead us to think that we can&#x27;t do an effective hands-on with Route53 without having to purchase a domain name from AWS or any other domain registrar. We should fear not, for AWS provides an option for a private hosted-zone to create and test the Route53 concepts.
Resources and Prerequisites
In preparing for the AWS certified solutions architect associate certification, I have been referring to the Ultimate AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate 2021 Udemy course.</span>

Vulnerability: Russian Opposition Email List Breach
Companies typically avoid providing details on their data breaches. Today we have a rare exception. The staff of the Russian opposition leader, Alexey Navalny, has posted a detailed report on both the breach they had earlier this year and their investigation into the breach. Unfortunately, the report is in Russian, so you might need to use Google Translate or auto-generated English subtitles in the video version that they posted on YouTube.</span>

                    <span>Event-Driven Architecture: Bust or Fact?
Alright, let&#x27;s face it—there is a lot of content talking about how REST vs messaging APIs and how one is more fir than the other for a microservices architecture design. I wrote a blog post about My journey to learning EDA that highlights what event-driven architecture is. Whether you are new to event-driven architecture (EDA) or have some background with it via dabbling with gRPC, kafka, rabbitMQ, Solace, or whatever messaging API, I am here to share with you 5 claims about EDA that I will be busting or confirming. 
 
 
I Will Have to Re-Design My Rest-Heavy Architecture From Scratch To Adopt EDA
 

MYTH
Advanced event brokers allow for protocol translation within the broker. What does this mean you might ask? Well, it is very common in any software architecture design approach to have a polyglot of protocols and APIs in an application. Whether you are using REST, or different messaging protocols (MQTT, AMQP, Solace, Kafka...etc) you would want your different microservices to communicate with each other.</span>

                    <span>In the reading of Natural Language Processing (NLP) applications, we inevitably encounter two main features in action, Categorization and Extraction, and learn how those can be manipulated in so many different ways to effectively address use cases that involve free-form text and the retrieval of information from it. We also hear a lot about Sentiment (which technically is not a separate feature but rather a specialization of the previous two). Finally, we have POS-tagging, which is only occasionally mentioned outside of deeply technical articles for linguists and NLP professionals. 
We don’t hear much about other NLP capabilities, and this is mainly because often, depending on how an NLP engine is designed, features beyond Categorization and Extraction are not present at all. Specifically, many NLP solutions today are based on Machine Learning algorithms, and ML rarely delivers great accuracy in problems that require both elevated precision and super-fine identification. Then again, some of these capabilities are incredibly useful, in fact sometimes even the only way to address a particular challenge. In the following, I make the case for one of these not-so-popular NLP tools: SAO (Subject-Action-Object).</span>

                    <span>Modern applications and services demand an always-on, low-latency experience for users no matter where they are on the planet. To meet these requirements, many deploy multiple instances of their applications and services across multiple cloud regions. This legacy approach leaves room for downtime and, even worse, inconsistencies in data.  

In this Refcard, we explore patterns and anti-patterns to multi-region database deployments — allowing your applications to survive a region failure without downtime while also ensuring consistent and low latency access to data no matter where you do business.</span>

                    <span>As an engineer, to succeed in product development, you have to change your perspective and move from valuing technology or the product to focusing on the business model. As an entrepreneur or a product manager, you have to understand that you are not developing a product but a business model. A product manager must continually ask themselves the question: What is the minimum experiment I should do next to minimize uncertainty (or learn) the most?
 
 
Using the question as a guide will help you get the evidence that the people need the product and there is sufficient market for it. You don&#x27;t require a large budget, scalable architecture, and a large team before validating the product-market fit.</span>

I’ll teach you how and why authentication systems hash passwords. Along the way you&#x27;ll learn about salting and key derivation functions. I&#x27;ll also demonstrate how to apply these concepts using a Django application server.
Every authentication system has to store some representation of your password. You must reproduce your password in response to a username and password challenge when you authenticate. The system compares your reproduced password with the stored representation of it as a means of authenticating you.</span>

There are plenty of failure possibilities with Scrum. Given that Scrum is a framework with a reasonable yet short “manual,” this effect should not surprise anyone. Neglecting the critical Scrum artifact for continuous value creation is one of the common Scrum anti-patterns. If your Scrum Team strives to make your customers’ lives easier Sprint after Sprint, beware of the oversized Product Backlog.

Take Slack for example. You might have heard about it, as it is probably one of the best team communication applications out there. It started as a simple communication tool for a group of game developers that wanted to communicate together.</span>

In this tutorial, I will explain different CI/CD concepts and tools provided by AWS for continuous integration and continuous delivery. I will be creating a Spring Boot microservice and deploy it to AWS EC2 instances running behind an application load balancer in an automated way using the AWS Code Pipeline. In this tutorial, you will have hands-on experience in developing a spring boot microservice and how it can be deployed in the cloud. You will learn about CI/CD and its benefits. What is AWS Code Commit, what is AWS Code build and AWS Code Deploy and their benefits. You will also learn about the AWS Code pipeline and how it can help you to orchestrate your software release process. This is part 1 of 2 videos:</span>

                    <span>1. Introduction
As Agile Coaches, many of us need to gauge the Maturity of our teams, and one of the tools which we all use is an agile Maturity assessment. However many of us tend to over-engineer it or tend to complicate the way our questions are framed and the way we analyze the responses.  In this article, I present a very simple yet effective way to get a quick dipstick check on where the Transformation is progressing.
2. Proposed Agile Maturity Assessment Model
As Agile professionals, we all are aware of the 4 Values and 12 Principles enshrined in the &quot;Manifesto for Agile Software Development.&quot;</span>

                    <span>Introduction
The article is roughly divided into four parts:
The first part will briefly introduce some real project data, including time-consuming data before and after optimization so that friends can understand how much optimization space is there for integration testing, and highlight why integration testing needs to be optimized.
The second part will introduce the composition of integration test execution time through some examples so that everyone knows where the time is spent.
In the third part, I will remove the &quot;cloud&quot; of the Spring test framework source code, and take the friends to briefly understand the principles of Spring integration testing.
Finally, I will give some useful suggestions for optimizing the execution time of Spring integration tests.
Integration Testing
Here are a few words. We have been pursuing automated testing for a long time. The fundamental reason is that automated testing is more reliable and cheaper than humans. Integration testing is an integral part of automated testing.</span>

                    <span>In some use cases, it is necessary to provide deep links in an Angular application. Without support for multiple languages, it is simply the URL + the angular route. With Angular i18n the different directories for the language build need to be supported. This article shows how to support language-independent deep linking. The AngularAndSpring project will serve as an example. It is a Spring Boot application that provides the backend with the rest endpoints and serves the Angular frontend in the &#x27;resources/static/&#x27; directory. 
Frontend
The frontend contains these file and directories:</span>

We appreciate this effort and the great results of open-source technology. In that article, Rick used the popular Star Schema Benchmark (SSB). 
We know this benchmark very well. One of Altinity founders and Percona CTO Vadim Tkachenko uses it quite regularly when comparing different open source analytical options (in 2017 and in 2020). A few weeks ago another real-time analytics company Rockset published their results claiming much better performance and efficiency compared to Druid. We decided to take a closer look at the Druid and Rockset approach, and see how ClickHouse can perform.</span>

Today, I will show you what this API evolution looks like through the subsequent Java releases and what were the reasons for its introduction to Java. I hope that it will give you some more knowledge about Optional class itself, help to convince your coworkers to start using it instead of a simple null check or even to decide which Java version to use in your company or private project.</span>

In 2021, applications are now the entryways most businesses use to connect to customers, and while this accelerated with the pandemic, it began long ago and will continue into the future. Seamless performance for these applications can mean the difference between gaining a loyal customer or losing trust. The threat of developer burnout, and application issues, are both very real and there are a few key practices that organizations can implement to support developers and set their teams up for success. 
Recognize Pressure Is Real and It’s Not Slowing Down

Here is the list of 5 things or decisions you should consider before starting a wireframe. These are the crucial questions that should be asked at the early stage of your project and it’ll smoothen your wireframing process.
1. Device Support
Usually, the stakeholders will tell you which devices to support, but sometimes you will realize that it will be cross-platform or responsive by studying the goals of the product. Or, you might have to select the best devices for the product.</span>

We can, of course, handle it, but we&#x27;ve got to be wary of the sirens of the cargo cult because you will often see something like this on the internet:</span>

                    <span>Application security is becoming a more and more important topic on a day-to-day basis. Unauthorized access to protected data can potentially cost millions of dollars in the form of various financial penalties. Almost every application needs some reliable tool to manage its users’ identities and accesses. 
There are a bunch of solutions on the market — both free and paid — that promise to provide such features. In today’s article, I will try to present you one of these tools, which as you probably guess from the title, will be Keycloak.</span>

                    <span>Our KFC project employs a microservice architecture, with components written in various languages and runtime environments, such as .NET, Ruby, and Go. Many of these components need to be able to make decisions based upon the authorization status of a user: who are they, what roles do they belong to, what actions are they able to perform, and to what? 
We needed a consistent way to use role-based access control between multiple independent languages, and we also needed a way to manage the permissions and access control lists (ACLs).</span>

                    <span>Introduction
With IoT technology moving as fast as it is, there is a lot of new technology to keep up with. It can be difficult to stay informed on the latest tech to facilitate a potential solution. In this article, we will break down four established asset tracking technologies to better understand their ideal use case in asset tracking. 
As is often the case, some of the newest options are the most expensive and feature-rich. Meanwhile, other options have dropped in cost due to large-scale adoption. A new generation of Bluetooth Low Energy, (BLE), Radio Frequency Identification (RFID), Long Range (LoRa), and Ultra-Wide Band (UWB) have brought new possibilities to industries hoping to solve the problem of, where did that thing go?</span>

                    <span>Java developers are usually required to take many actions before we can begin developing and deploying cloud-native microservices on Kubernetes. First, we have to configure everything from the integrated development environment (IDE) to build tools such as Maven or Gradle. We also need to configure the command-line tools used for containerization and generating the Kubernetes manifest. If we don’t want to spin up a Kubernetes cluster locally, we also must connect to a remote Kubernetes cluster for continuous testing and deployment.
Developers should spend less time on configuration and more time accelerating the inner-loop development cycle of building, testing, and deploying our applications. Ideally, we should be able to continuously develop applications in a pre-configured Kubernetes environment.</span>

                    <span>Introduction
We are in the Digital Economy and as it applies to all economies in the world, the success of this relatively new but no longer nascent economy will depend on how well the stakeholders of this economy maximize their resources by reusing, replicating, connecting, and interoperating them. The value of synergy is always greater than the value of individual components contributing to it and this force multiplier needs to be capitalized in a massive way by modern-day enterprises if they wish to succeed in the digital economy.
The advertisement moolah that Google and Facebook rake in is precisely because they do not look at their business entities in siloes; rather they connect and integrate valuable customer data points from various entities like; for example, Gmail, Google Maps, and YouTube to generate one unified persona related data impression that becomes the basis for their targeted advertisements and their consequent success rates. Likewise, Netflix integrates and converts data on the subscriber consumption pattern to intelligent movie recommendations that lead to higher viewership, greater new subscriptions, and improved Net Promoter Scores (read word of mouth).</span>

                    <span>Web Sockets and asynchronous message transmissions over socket connections is probably one of the most difficult tasks you can possibly do in any web application. Hence, to make it manageable, it needs to be simplified, the same way the gearbox in your car is simple to use, even though it probably involves thousands of moving parts. In this article I will walk you through how to create a live chat client using SignalR, Web Sockets and Magic. If you wish to follow the tutorial though, the first thing you&#x27;ll have to do is to download Magic.
The Angular frontend
First we&#x27;ll need a frontend. Use the Angular CLI to create a new Angular project and name it &quot;chat&quot;. Open a terminal on your development machine and execute the following command in it.</span>

                    <span>What did you feel while seeing the price tag of a product in a supermarket? You may not realize it, but machines can read these incredibly nuanced subtilities of human expressions, and retailers can use it to their advantage. A device loaded with a specific software program can predict whether a person is smiling out of frustration or joy. Human-computer interaction has gone beyond the realms of sci-fi fantasies and turned into reality. The rise of emotionally aware machines has blurred the human-machine divide, and it is now redefining the way people experience technology.
What Is Affective Computing? 
Emotion AI, also known as Affective Computing, is all about how AI can decode the emotional status of a human being by analyzing their facial expressions, such as head motion, facial distortions, movement of jaws, and speech pattern, etc. It detects, recognizes, and emulates human emotions through a programmed AI neural network. Without a doubt, humans can analyze and interpret complex emotional signals better. However, the gap is narrowing faster than you can imagine, thanks to advancements in big data capability and powerful algorithms.</span>

                    <span>Welcome to this series of blog posts that covers Redis Streams with the help of a practical example. We will use a sample application to make Twitter data available for search and query in real-time. RediSearch and Redis Streams serve as the backbone of this solution that consists of several co-operating components, each of which will be covered in a dedicated blog post.
The code is available in this GitHub repo - https://github.com/abhirockzz/redis-streams-in-action</span>

In this article, I am going to look at Redis versus Tarantool. At a first glance, they are quite alike — in-memory, NoSQL, key value. But we are going to look deeper. My goal is to find meaningful similarities and differences, I am not going to claim that one is better than the other.
There are three main parts to my story:</span>

                    <span>If your business is customer-centric and cares the most about changing customer demands in today’s competitive market, then probably your tech organization has to think about its strategies for its release model for all the software deliveries. On-demand releases become a trend in the last 5 years, where some of the popular tech companies started this model to increase their product usage and target a high volume of diverse customers with diverse product needs.
What’s an On-Demand Software Release?
On-demand releases are nothing but small incremental product features deployed in the production environment frequently as a part of continuous integration in an automated way following strict agile methodology.</span>

                    <span>Web based terminal access is one of those crucial components to have if you truly want to build your own DIY cloud system. The first time I came to appreciate web terminals, was with Digital Ocean&#x27;s droplets, which gave me a web based terminal, allowing me to directly modify my server any ways I saw fit through my browser. Golly gosh that was a najs day.
With a web terminal, you&#x27;ve got all of these features &quot;for free.&quot;</span>

                    <span>Kubernetes has dramatically shifted the trade-offs of on-prem versus SaaS deployments. Thanks to the rich abstractions Kubernetes provides, deploying software on-premises can be significantly easier than it used to be. Because Kubernetes has achieved such high market penetration (and still growing), it is now a viable target environment for many software products. Nevertheless, Kubernetes requires external tools to be production ready, especially on an on-prem deployment.
The purpose of this article is to list tools that everyone should be aware of when it’s time to move an on-prem Kubernetes cluster to production, and by on-prem, we mean not in a cloud environment. In the cloud, it is obviously better to rely on cloud services offered by the provider.</span>

Need of Hypothetical Indexes:
As the name suggests, these are not real indexes, these are hypothetical indexes i.e. they are virtual indexes that PostgreSQL query planner does not consider when running queries.</span>

I have tried a lot of types of devices using the same app (smart life) and tuya cloud. Officials say there are more than 200,000 SKUs; well I think they are quite cheap and widely distributed. However, it is hard to connect Arduino with Tuya cloud.

Site reliability engineering (SRE) practices help organizations by ensuring the smooth functioning of their deliverables with utmost reliability and resilience. These can be achieved by a set of well-defined tools that are deployed at every phase of the production system to keep up with SRE best practices.
This blog identifies and lists the chain of top SRE tools and their significance towards ensuring the reliability of the architecture.</span>

                    <span>Introduction
Smart parking development implies an IoT-based system that sends data about free and occupied parking places via web/mobile applications. The IoT device, including sensors and microcontrollers, is located in each parking place. The user receives a live update about the availability of all parking places and chooses the best one.
In order to investigate the technologies behind the smart parking solution, we implemented an internal research project. The main idea was the creation of smart parking using the Internet of Things and ultrasonic sensors, where available parking places could be displayed in a web application.</span>

                    <span>A common problem when automating tests are tests which require a visual comparison to a previous state. This can be a very time consuming task when you need to execute many of these testing tasks. But not anymore, the Robot Framework DocTest library comes to the rescue!
1. Introduction
Even if you do not know what Robot Framework is, it is really worth the effort to continue reading. The DocTest library might save you a lot of testing time, but it requires some knowledge of Robot Framework. In case you do not know what Robot Framework is, read some of the previous posts in order to get a good introduction.</span>

                    <span>What Is Testing Maturity?
The software testing process is an ever-shifting entity. It has to keep changing to accommodate changing requirements, device-browser-OS releases, and numerous other factors that show up with increasing frequency. Inability to change will cause the pipeline to stagnate and roll out software that doesn’t match current performance and design standards.
Testing Maturity designates the extent to which the process is optimized and formalized to accept and incorporate changes. This ranges from ad-hoc practices, formally established stages, result metrics, and optimization efforts on each level. Testing Maturity reveals how well the process is shaped, measured, managed, monitored and the results it yields.</span>

As an AWS administrator, it is your job to make sure users enable MFA. In order to auto-enable this feature, the below policy can be applied to users, which will allow them to enable MFA if it is not enabled already. Once MFA is enabled, only then other activities can be resumed.</span>

                    <span>In 2002, Jeff Bezos issued what is now known as the API mandate: The new direction at Amazon would be that all capabilities would have to be designed and exposed as APIs. This is an early version of what we today call API First. Most importantly, the mandate had a laser focus on the fact that APIs need the network effect to produce the most value, and thus it simply said that APIs are not optional anymore.
The original mandate is preserved in a GitHub Gist that captures a reaction to it, which is Stevie’s (Steve Yegge’s) famous Google platform rant.</span>

                    <span>TL;DR: The Frustrated Scrum Master — When All the Effort Leads Nowhere
There are plenty of failure possibilities with Scrum. Given that Scrum is a framework with a reasonable yet short &quot;manual,&quot; this effect should not surprise anyone. One failure symptom of a botched agile transformation is the frustrated Scrum Master.

                    <span>Preface
If you’re a MySQL DBA or a developer that deals with MySQL instances daily, it will probably not come as a surprise if you hear that you should not run big data sets on MySQL. Ask almost any MySQL DBA, and you will hear something like:
&quot;MySQL is not a fit!&quot;
&quot;Have you looked into NoSQL?&quot;
&quot;Use MongoDB.&quot;
Some of these responses indeed have merit — for example, NoSQL-based database management systems such as MongoDB can certainly be useful when dealing with big data sets. However, contrary to popular belief, MySQL shouldn’t be so quickly ruled out — in some scenarios, MySQL (or MariaDB) might prove to be even better options for big data than their NoSQL counterparts! In this article, we will explore the things you should consider when answering the question: “Is MySQL a good option for my big data project?”</span>

                    <span>Online shopping is growing at a fast pace and is expected to reach $1 trillion by 2022. But, eCommerce shopping won’t be the same as it is now. There are several eCommerce trends that will shape the future of the eCommerce industry.
Advancement in voice search technologies, adoption of VR, acceptance of bitcoins, and usage of chatbots for personalized product recommendations are some of the trends that will improve the overall shopping experience of the users.</span>

                    <span>What is FHIR?
To be short and precise, FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) is a standard for exchanging healthcare information electronically.
FHIR has been developed by HL7 for using it as a stand-alone exchange standard or to be used as with other standards such as HL7 v2, CDA and CCDA</span>

                    <span>Traditionally, a majority of our applications relied on relational database systems (RDBMS) for their data storage needs. But RDBMS systems are not very efficient at handling high volumes of connected data. A graph database is purpose-built to store this category of connected data. 
In this article, we will explore the basic concepts of a graph database and then look at some examples of graph data modeling and querying by using the Neo4j graph database.</span>

                    <span>The term technical debt was coined by Ward Cunningham in 1992. To understand technical debt, let&#x27;s compare it with financial debt.
Financial debt is an arrangement that gives the borrowing party permission to borrow money under the condition that it is to be paid back at a later date, usually with interest. Financial debt is generally needed due to overspending, lack of financial knowledge, poorly managed budget, etc. to name a few. You might also raise a financial debt to invest in your capital-intensive business, education, etc. which would bring returns in the future. Financial debt is not always a bad thing as long as you&#x27;re aware of the consequences and always keep it under control.</span>

                    <span>COVID-19 Boosts Tech Innovations 
COVID-19 has shaken the world to its core. Societies are disrupted, countries are under lockdowns, and many people are confused. Although this may sound like some sort of sci-fi, this is the current reality. However, just like any type of crisis, it forced people to develop means of dealing with the issue.
The virus took its toll on the life of society but technologies have experienced an unprecedented boost in development. After all, COVID-19 showed that society is highly relying on technologies to maintain its functions. As a result, now we can enjoy robot and drone deliveries, telehealth solutions, AI-powered services, and VR/AR — everything powered by the Internet. Here we will take a look at the top 7 tech innovations to watch during the pandemic.</span>

                    <span>CockroachDB is a cloud-native SQL database that features both scalability and consistency. The database is designed to withstand data center failures by deploying multiple instances of symmetric nodes in a cluster consisting of several machines, disks, and data centers. Kubernetes’ built-in capabilities to scale and survive node failures make it well suited to orchestrate CockroachDB’s databases. This is particularly for the reason that Kubernetes simplifies cluster management and helps maintain high-availability by replicating data across independent nodes. 
This guide focuses on how OpenEBS LocalPV devices can be used to persist storage for Kubernetes-Hosted CockroachDB clusters.</span>

                    <span>The Java programming language has become so popular that, when people say the word ‘java’, most people no longer think of coffee! The Java language is object-oriented and it supports developers with a library of classes called Java API. It has a long and rich history and is widely recognized for its performance, security, and dependability. In this article, we review four important reasons for Java&#x27;s popularity among developers.

                    <span>JSON and XML fulfill a similar purpose of organizing complex data in an understandable and readable format to various APIs and programming languages, such as Python, Ruby, and JavaScript. This type of technology is essential because structuring the data is what allows us to share it successfully. However, despite aiming for the same goal, they have different ways to operate.
This article compares JSON and XML to fully understand their benefits and why they stand on opposite sides of the wrestling ring. I start by providing a definition for each, followed by an in-depth look at their differences and similarities.</span>

                    <span>Kubernetes (k8s) is an increasingly popular container orchestration platform. With that popularity has grown an ecosystem of tools and frameworks. One such tool is Kustomize.
K8s desired states are declaratively described in resource description files such as deployment, services, configmaps, secrets, etc. As we vary the environments from dev to QA to prod these configurations to change. The database may change from an embedded H2 in dev to a MariaDB in QA to Oracle in prod, the amount of allocated memory for a container may change, secrets of user rid and password for the database may also change. Managing all these varying YAML files of deployment, services, etc. per environment can be quite a chore. Configuration management tools maintain consistency across these environments.</span>

In this article, we will learn how to implement the Image Classification feature in a Flutter application. Image classification uses the transfer learning algorithm to perform multi-level learning training. Huawei ML Kit provides many useful machine learning-related features to developers, and one of them is Image Classification.
About Image Classification
Image classification is one of the features of the HMS ML Kit. Through this service, we can classify the objects in images. This service analyses an image, classifies it into possible categories in the real world, like people, animals, objects, etc. and it returns the recognized results.</span>

                    <span>While loads of digital video game vendors exist, Valve reigns supreme as arguably the most popular. Its Steam Link hardware debuted in 2015 as a means of streaming Steam games from a PC over a home network. This in-home streaming feature allowed for playing video games on a TV or projector for a console experience with PC gaming. However, in 2018, Valve halted production of the Steam Link. Alternatives such as the third-party Moonlight or Parsec for game streaming exist. But Valve released its own Steam Link app for Android, as well as the Raspberry Pi 3.

Given an opportunity, it’s easy to assume the role of an expert and tell others how wrong they are, why their product isn’t good enough, why their idea will never work, how they should behave, what they should do. Why seek permission when we feel right in our criticism?
Now let’s turn this around. Are your critics telling you the blunt facts you need to hear? Think for a moment about how you feel when you are on the receiving end of this criticism – angry, defensive, resentful, frustrated, sad, maybe even a little bit devastated.</span>

Agile helps teams to become more flexible and adaptive which is essential for staying competitive in today’s business environment where customer needs are constantly changing and evolving. But what exactly do we mean by being “more flexible and adaptive?”
Request Management: Product Increments
Let’s imagine a team that is working on a software product. The product is going to be released in several versions, and the Product Manager creates a roadmap to plan the timeline for these releases (please see the picture below). Each release itself can be broken down into smaller chunks of work that are usually called product increments and form a Sprint (typically 2-4 weeks long).</span>

In order to bridge the gap of delivering products quickly, all organizations are shifting the base architectural design patterns to distributed system architecture. It&#x27;s kind of common practice to either bootstrap or transition the existing applications to containerized or server-less architectures.
Managing clustered applications can soon become an overhead when the organization scale and hence increases a dire need for a platform that can support automation of all the tasks related to management, deployment, scaling of these clusters.</span>

                    <span>It was only a handful of years ago that the low-code story was innocently simple. Instead of coding software line-by-line by hand, use a low-code tool that provided visual abstractions that enabled developers to shortcut the hand-coding process by dragging and dropping tasks onto workflows, widgets onto screens, and the like.
Then along came no-code. The contrast between the two approaches was clear. Low-code targeted professional developers, simplifying their work by taking ‘plumbing’ tasks off their plate, while also facilitating collaboration with business stakeholders.</span>

                    <span>Engineering teams can scale their Kubernetes costs and burn their budget with the same ease by which they scale their infrastructure. Thanks to Kubecost&#x27;s real-time alerting, the risk of upsetting the finance team can be mitigated. Kubernetes is well-known for its ability to help scale applications rapidly and with ease, but this ability comes with some tradeoffs. Before Kubernetes, teams had to follow a more deliberate procurement approval process to change the capacity allocation. Today, that scaling process has been democratized, and teams can easily scale their clusters up or down.
With the ability to create more frequent changes to infrastructure resources come more opportunities to misallocate and over-allocate costly resources. In this model, technical teams can far exceed their expense budget without even realizing it, while financial managers would only notice it after the fact leading to avoidable organizational stress. So, how do you stay on top of your Kubernetes spending if your resources change daily?</span>

                    <span>There are certain industries that greatly benefit from high-performing, low-latency, geo-distributed technologies, while other organizations might be more focused on vertically scaling architectures. This is dependent on numerous factors including the data pipeline, network, data structure, type of product or solution, short and long-term goals, etc. While there are currently many databases and tools that provide vertical scaling capabilities, there are not many that focus on horizontal scaling -- but there’s still a need for both.
Latency
Before jumping into specific industries that benefit from high-performing, low-latency, geo-distributed databases (it’s a mouthful, I know), let’s define a few terms here. High-performing is pretty self-explanatory so I’ll skip over that one. For the next term, I’ll refer to my colleague Jacob Cohen’s blog on Geo-Distributed Databases. Latency generally measures the duration between an action and a response. In user-facing applications, that can be narrowed down to the delay between when a user makes a request and when the application responds to a request. So, technologies that enable low latency usually improve performance and response times, leading to improved user experience and cost savings.</span>

I know from previous analysis runs of the same software that it already had problems with structural erosion. Years ago I analyzed Cassandra 1.2.6 and found pretty big cycle groups for Java files as well as for packages. The maintainability level was only 9.4% (everything under 50% is concerning) while the metric “Propagation Cost” has a value of 62%. That means that every change will affect 62% of all code directly or indirectly which also is not a good thing because it significantly increases the chance of regression bugs.

                    <span>At Ubiq Security we focus on data security and making it easier for developers to incorporate encryption into their applications.  As part of our work, we spend time on Slack, Stack Overflow, Reddit, etc. and we see several common mistakes that can cause security vulnerabilities that are easy to resolve.  While we don’t think any developer wants to make an insecure product, it is easy to understand how developers not experienced in data security might not realize the impact of grabbing some sample code from the Internet and incorporating it into their application.  I often say that writing programs incorporating encryption or data security is not like other software development.  Just because an application runs, doesn’t mean you are done or that your application is secure.
Common Mistake 1: Inadvertently Reducing the Range of A Hashed Value
I have lost count of how many times I have seen someone use sha256 thinking they are creating a 256-bit value stored in 32 bytes when they are actually creating a 128-bit value stored in 32 bytes.</span>

In this part, we&#x27;re going to explore how the different parts of the system interface with one another, to set the stage for our next post, where we Dockerize everything!

I first met Icecast (https://icecast.org/) when I worked at a web-hosting startup around the turn of the millennium. One night, one of my co-workers and I had the crazy idea to load a bunch of audio files on the networked file server and stream them to our workstations. We could listen to music while we worked 90+ hours a week. Strange times. After realizing it wasn&#x27;t as simple as exporting .ogg files over HTTP, we found Icecast (and its pal, Ices2) and built a rudimentary, local-network broadcast radio station.</span>

                    <span class="article-reading-time">(4 min)</span>
                    <span>1. Choice of Programming Language
The language depends on the type of cluster. A cluster can comprise of two modes, i.e., Standard and High Concurrency. A High Concurrency cluster supports R, Python, and SQL, whereas a Standard cluster supports Scala, Java, SQL, Python, and R.
Spark is developed in Scala and is the underlying processing engine of Databricks. Scala performs better than Python and SQL. Hence, for the Standard cluster, Scala is the recommended language for developing Spark jobs.
2. ADF for Invoking Databricks Notebooks
Eliminate Hardcoding: In certain scenarios, Databricks requires some configuration information related to other Azure services such as storage account name, database server name, etc. The ADF pipeline uses pipeline variables for storing the configuration details. During the Databricks notebook invocation within the ADF pipeline, the configuration details are transferred from pipeline variables to Databricks widget variables, thereby eliminating hardcoding in the Databricks notebooks.
Notebook Dependencies: It is relatively easier to establish notebook dependencies in ADF than in Databricks itself. In case of failure, debugging a series of notebook invocations in an ADF pipeline is convenient.

Cheap: When a Notebook is invoked through ADF, the Ephemeral job cluster pattern is used for processing the spark job because the lifecycle of the cluster is tied to the job lifecycle. These short-life clusters cost lesser than the clusters which are created using the Databricks UI.
3. Using Widget Variables
The configuration details are made accessible to the Databricks code through the widget variables. The configuration data is transferred from pipeline variable to widget variables when the notebook is invoked in the ADF pipeline. During the development phase, to model the behavior of a notebook run by ADF, widget variables are manually created using the following line of code.</span>

                    <span>It is incredible just how much information we have today stored in PDF format. According to the PDF Association, approximately 2.5 trillion PDFs are created every year, making up 6 percent of the web. As a web developer, though, PDFs aren&#x27;t always the most outstanding experience online:
Viewing experiences vary significantly across different users and devices because they depend on a PDF viewer. Whether it is embedded in web browsers or free online libraries, some viewers are better than others. Adobe Acrobat Reader is generally the universal standard for viewing PDFs properly. Google Chrome is also very common. However, many things have worked in Acrobat that still don&#x27;t work or render correctly in Chrome.
It becomes difficult for me to be able to incorporate PDFs into the rest of my website. Most often, PDFs would prompt users to download PDFs on their devices.
Converting PDFs to HTML is complicated and unreliable. If I want to present content inside a webpage that is in PDF format, I might often flatten it to PDF to make it easier to embed.
I have no visibility into how my visitor is viewing those PDFs. This means that I have no idea if someone is reading certain pages, how long they spend on those pages, etc.
Fortunately, Adobe PDF Embed is an excellent solution to solve all of these challenges.</span>

                    <span>As the New York Times best-selling author, Brené Brown says, “Leadership is not about titles or the corner office. It’s about the willingness to step up, put yourself out there, and lean into courage.” In today’s cultural and work environment, we’re no longer able to avoid sensitive and pressing issues, but many leaders are paralyzed by the fear of making mistakes in the way they address them. This is especially true when it comes to addressing concerns around diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI).
That’s why our host, Federico Toledo, wraps up season three of Quality Sense with an illuminating interview with a leader in the DEI space. Ash Coleman has had a very unique and interesting career path that has led her to her current role as the Head of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion at Credit Karma. Before that, she was a professional chef who made a transition into software testing. These professional experiences have led her to understand what goes into making amazing experiences and products that meet the requirements of a diverse population.</span>

Since TypeScript 3.4, we’ve been able to use the as const notation for creating “const assertions” on our literals. This is used to signal to the compiler that any object properties of the literal are read-only, any array literals are read-only, and lastly that any literal types used cannot be widened.</span>

                    <span>Introduction
Project management isn’t just about managing projects. It is a collaborative effort of stakeholders, ranging from in-house teams to outsourced partners. In all fairness, the latter is a more complicated space since an outsider in a possibly different time zone has to access your data, processes, and teams. While outsourcing digital product development projects, enterprises have a long road to trek. Issues from lack of credibility to unclear objectives are directly responsible for a failed engagement and ultimately a sub-standard quality of end output. 
If your outsourcing partner is not performing as per expectations, the fault may be at your end. Here are the top mistakes that project managers knowingly or unknowingly commit while hiring product development partners.</span>

Today’s business demands high-quality data not in a matter of hours or days but in minutes or seconds.  
The typical steps to update the data lake are (a) build incremental data (b) read the existing data lake files, update incremental changes, and rewrite the data lake files (note: S3 files are immutable).  This also brings in the challenge of ACID compliance between readers and writers of a data lake.</span>

If you design the microservices architecture in the right way, it certainly becomes a peace of mind. However, if you make some basic mistakes while designing microservices, it becomes a pain of mind in no time. Hence, it is important to not make some basic mistakes in the first place, so as you don&#x27;t have to rectify and fix them at a later stage when your microservice is already in production and being used by a vast number of consumers.

This is article is a follow-up to Data Platform as a Service, describes the high-level architecture, and goes into details on Data Lake. We will detail the rest of the blocks and components shown in the next articles.

In this post, I&#x27;m going to walk you through how to build a production-grade HTTPs secured Nginx server with Docker, Docker Compose, Let’s Encrypt (its client certbot).

                    <span>“It is not necessary to change. Survival is not mandatory.” -W. Edwards Deming Work takes time to flow through an organization and ultimately be deployed to production where it captures value. It’s critical to reduce time-to-production. Software - for many organizations and industries - is a competitive advantage. Organizations break their larger software ambitions into smaller, independently deployable, feature -centric batches of work - microservices. In order to reduce the round-trip between stations of work, organizations collapse or consolidate as much of them as possible and automate the rest; developers and operations beget “devops,” cloud-based services and platforms automate operations work and break down the need for ITIL tickets and change management boards. But velocity, for velocity’s sake, is dangerous. Microservices invite architectural complexity that few are prepared to address. In this talk, we’ll look at how high-performance organizations like Ticketmaster, Alibaba, and Netflix make short work of that complexity with Spring Boot and Spring Cloud. In this workshop we&#x27;ll look at how to build cloud-native Java systems that are elastic, agile, observable and robust.</span>

                    <span>For many companies, getting products out the door faster is one of the main reasons to adopt DevOps. But speeding up software delivery is only one aspect of why companies should embrace an agile CI/CD approach. There are other things to take into consideration and, if you are a financial institution, the list can be even bigger.
I recently chatted with Ben Angell and Sanmat Jhanjhari of Nationwide Building Society as part of the virtual DevOps Enterprise Summit Europe. Ben leads the DevOps Engineering team and Sanmat is lead DevOps architect at the UK-based mutual financial institution, which is also the largest building society in the world.</span>

Introduction
This sample project demonstrates a basic setup of a server and a client. The communication between the server and client happens through HTTP, so there is no encryption at all yet. The goal is to ensure that all communication will be encrypted.</span>

                    <span>Identity and access management are critical components of many applications. However, enterprise companies that are using multiple EKS, AKS, or GKE cloud Kubernetes clusters for various projects may find it challenging to identify the right level of access for different users, especially when there are multiple users and groups of users who are coming, going, and moving between teams.  
As teams expand their usage of Kubernetes, clusters and workloads will exist in different environments. One team may be building their stack on cloud provider “A,” while another team is building a stack on cloud provider “B.” Even on a single public cloud service, clusters may exist in different environments, and IT isn’t even aware of these things. This makes tracking all of the individual logins and permissions across the organization next to impossible, especially when there are multiple accounts and access levels to manage. And the problem only grows in complexity as more people on-board, off-board, or change teams, and projects multiply.</span>

                    <span>If global companies manage their data efficiently, they would never have to lock horns with deploying data science strategies. It does sound simple until you know that ‘efficiently’ is an ocean of complexities and beyond the expertise of most businesses. Capturing and orchestrating data is a rough path but a necessity to undo data silos and provide immediate results to on-demand search queries. And that is why we need data orchestration that is purposefully meant to enable quick access and yet protect it from widespread fragmentation.
How Does Big Data Orchestration Work? 
Orchestration tools are a middleware layer between the data warehouse (source points) and the business applications such as CRM, BI Analytics, etc. Through pre-built connectors and API adapters, these tools perform rapid integration of all source points with the main silos. It simplifies data monitoring from a single point while enabling the teams to perform seamless fetching. All of this is achieved without having to develop custom scripts or devoting additional resources.</span>

                    <span>Introduction
Chances are when you hear &quot;0.77 cents on the dollar,&quot; an increasingly contentious subject — the gender pay gap — comes to mind.  Today, we will explore a US Bureau of Labor Statistics dataset containing information about America&#x27;s workforce (as of Jan. 2015) to answer the following questions:
Which industries are most and least affected?
Is the gender wage gap the same across all industries?
How much does an average American salary vary by gender?
To answer these questions, we&#x27;ll be importing the dataset mentioned above (available on Kaggle) into an Arctype SQLite database, where we&#x27;ll use queries and dashboards to manipulate and interpret the data.</span>

                    <span>Due to the exponential growth of digitalization, the entire globe is creating a minimum of 2.5 quintillion (2500000000000 Million) bytes of data every day and that we can denote as Big Data. Data generation is happening from everywhere starting from social media sites, various sensors, satellites, purchase transactions, Mobile, GPS signals, and much more. With the advancement of technology, there is no sign of the slowing down of data generation, instead, it will grow in a massive volume. All the major organizations, retailers, different vertical companies, and enterprise products have started focusing on leveraging big data technologies to produce actionable insights, business expansion, growth, etc. 
Overview
Lambda Architecture is an excellent design framework for the huge volume of data processing using both streaming as well as batch processing methods.  The streaming processing method stands for analyzing the data on the fly when it is in motion without persisting on storage area whereas the batch processing method is applied when data already in rest, means persisted in storage area like databases, data warehousing systems, etc. Lambda Architecture can be utilized effectively to balance latency, throughput, scaling, and fault-tolerance to achieve comprehensive and accurate views from the batch and real-time stream processing simultaneously.</span>

                    <span>Last week saw the release of Perl 5.34.0 (you can get it here), and with it comes a year&#x27;s worth of new features, performance enhancements, bug fixes, and other improvements. It seems like a good time to highlight some of my favorite changes over the past decade and a half, especially for those with more dated knowledge of Perl. You can always click on the headers below for the full releases&#x27; perldelta pages.
Perl 5.10 (2007)
This was a big release, coming as it did over five years after the previous major 5.8 release. Not that Perl developers were idle—but it wouldn&#x27;t be until version 5.14 that the language would adopt a steady yearly release cadence.</span>

                    <span>Look, we know the software development process is not an easy one to measure and manage, particularly as it becomes more complex and more decentralized. In many companies, there are multiple teams working on smaller parts of a big project-and these teams are spread all over the world. It&#x27;s challenging to tell who is doing what and when, where the blockers are and what kind of waste has delayed the process. Without a reliable set of data points to track across teams, it&#x27;s virtually impossible to see how each piece of the application development process puzzle fits together. DORA metrics can help shed light on how your teams are performing in DevOps.
What Are DORA Metrics?
Well, these metrics didn&#x27;t just come out of thin air. DORA metrics are a result of six years&#x27; worth of surveys conducted by the DORA (DevOps Research and Assessments) team, that, among other data points, specifically measure deployment frequency (DF), mean lead time for changes (MLT), mean time to recover (MTTR) and change failure rate (CFR). These metrics serve as a guide to how well the engineering teams are performing and how successful a company is at DevOps, ranging from &quot;low performers&quot; to &quot;elite performers.&quot; They help answer the question: Are we better at DevOps now than we were a year ago?</span>

                    <span>In the U.S. alone, pipeline operators maintain around 3 million miles of natural gas distribution mains and pipelines. They often run through stretches of remote wilderness, across difficult-to-access terrain, or deep underwater. While traditional monitoring tools like SCADA systems can be effective, they also have significant weak points.
American water infrastructure is similar in length, made up of around 2.2 million miles of pipes that can be difficult to monitor due to location. Innovations are helping to provide more effective pipeline monitoring solutions. Internet of Things (IoT) devices could have a major impact on how pipelines are monitored. Why is the IoT the foundation for a new kind of intelligent pipeline monitoring?</span>

PEM is a scheme for encoding x509 certificates and private keys as Base64 ASCII strings. This makes it easier to handle your certificates. You can simply provide keys and certificates to the app as string parameters (e.g. through environment variables). This is especially useful if your applications are running in containers, where mounting files to containers makes the deployment pipeline a bit more complex. In this post, I&#x27;ll show you two ways to use PEM certificates in Kafka.</span>

Kubernetes adoption is on the rise as organizations increasingly get a grasp on what is needed to effectively manage and scale the popular platform.
That’s one of the key takeaways from a recent Traefik Labs survey of 1,097 respondents, the majority of which were software engineers and DevOps professionals. The survey found that the adoption of Kubernetes is at a strong 70%, indicating that the platform is rapidly increasing in adoption. Yet 58% say they run less than half of their business-critical applications on the container-orchestration system, implying room for wider Kubernetes uses throughout most organizations.</span>

While public container registries are accessible and convenient, private registries can better integrate into existing CI/CD workflows, offer greater control over access and security, as well as help ensure build repeatability and reliability. This Refcard covers key container concepts and terminology; common use cases; and guidelines for container registry configuration, operation, security, and storage.</span>

                    <span>Background
In my previous post Managing Secrets Deployment in GitOps Workflow I talked about SealedSecrets, which is one of the ways to keep Kubernetes secrets in version control to implement the GitOps workflow. This approach has the following downsides:
The sealed secret is encrypted with its own random asymmetric key that is specific to the sealed secret name and namespace and therefore copy-pasting the encrypted data for another secret or in another namespace won&#x27;t work.
Secondly, by default, SealedSecrets generated for a cluster won&#x27;t work with another cluster because the installation of Bitnami Controller creates a new pair of public/private keys. This makes the overall GitOps implementation approach cumbersome. 
One solution may be to export and import the same set of keys from one cluster to another. However, if the key on a cluster gets compromised, it would grant access to all sealed secrets on all clusters with the same key pair.</span>

                    <span>When you want to erase sensitive data from your hard drive permanently, make sure it is not recoverable in any manner. You can try permanent deletion that includes, erasing or ‘wiping’ data using various overwriting techniques. In this article, we&#x27;ve shared the best effective methods to wipe hard drive data beyond the scope of recovery.
We all keep some personal data on our devices. But, storage devices, like hard drives, have a lifespan after which, they may fail to perform, and you may want to dispose them. You may also want to donate or share your device with your friends or family. Whatever the situation is, you must wipe the hard drive to prevent any unauthorized access.</span>

                    <span>Introduction
The HTTP Custom Caching policy enables you to store HTTP responses from an API implementation or an API proxy for reuse. To optimize against computation-heavy processing, this policy avoids performing multiple calls to the backend when the response of a service does not change often. This policy uses a cache, which enables a faster service for data requests.
In Mule 4, Mulesoft already provides an HTTP cache policy, which is available out of the box with standard configuration and works very well with runtime object-store v2. If an existing out-of-the-box policy is available then why do we need a custom policy?</span>

                    <span>Getting Started with Apache Camel? This post is for you. But I am not going to dive into how to write the Camel route, there are plenty of materials out there that do a better job than me. A good place to get started is the one and only Camel Blog, it gives you all the latest and greatest news from the community. If you want to start from the basics, I highly recommend Camel in Action II Book. It has everything you need to know about writing Camel. Or join the Camel community mailing list or Zulip to ask questions, it&#x27;s very friendly and welcoming.
If you are a returning Camel rider, I would go through this post, where it will get you up to speed on what to expect.  Another good resource is the FAQ page. I found the majority of the getting started enquiries can be found here.</span>

                    <span>In Analysis

  
    
     A business analyst and a developer may have different objectives and perspectives 
     
   Here’s an example of a conversation that you may have been part of sometime in your life as a developer. 

 
 
Business Analyst: Our next user story involves creating an API (let’s call it “Customer API”).
 
 
Developer A: How novel! That’s what I did yesterday and the day before and the day before that.
 
 
Business Analyst: Great, should I let the clients know that it wouldn’t take as long to build it?
 
 
Developer A: Hold on. We haven’t even heard the requirements for Customer API.
 
 
Business Analyst: It’s just a couple of hundred fields that Customer API needs to send to another downstream API to perform the transaction.
 
 
Developer A: And how will we know the values for these fields that Customer API needs to send?
 
 
Business Analyst: I’ll take care of it. I have already spoken to the lead developer from the downstream API team, and he’s sent me a spreadsheet. It has all the fields and the values that need to be part of the request body. He’s also sent me a document with information on the headers and auth details required to call the downstream API.
 
 
Developer A: Is this downstream API available in a testing environment? A playground, maybe?
 
 
Business Analyst: They’re still working on building the downstream API, so they don’t have a working version yet.
 

In Development
Developer A gets to work. She pairs with Developer B, another application developer on her team, to finish the Customer API story. Business Analyst sends them an email with a spreadsheet containing the fields and a document that includes the API currently in development by the downstream API team. It seems like Developer A and Developer B have all the information required to start building the Customer API, so they come up with the following list of tasks:</span>

You are modernizing a Core System and have defined a Target Business Architecture (BA) that will replace it. You are following the defined modernization roadmap and are in charge of the modernization of one of the Business Capabilities of the Target Business Architecture. Now, you need to understand how the current Core System is addressing the Business Capability, i.e., you have to map which legacy system is providing the business capabilities associated with this system in the BA. 
Usually, the core system will be a set of monoliths, applications, services, and transactions that are integrated and tightly coupled so that if you map all of them and its integrations, you will end up with a picture like this one:</span>

                    <span>Container registries serve as libraries to store and access third-party container images required during the build phase of the SDLC and the images produced for deployment to test, staging, and production environments. While public container registries are accessible and convenient, private registries can better integrate into existing CI/CD workflows, offer greater control over access and security, as well as help ensure build repeatability and reliability. This Refcard covers key container concepts and terminology; common use cases; and guidelines for container registry configuration, operation, security, and storage.</span>

                    <span>Looking for a way to jazz up your websites or applications? Creating compelling imagery to accompany your copywriting, service offerings, and projects can be an excellent method for ramping up your content. One type of imagery that has become incredibly popular, especially during the digital age, is the composite image. A composite image is made up of two or more images, which are merged together to create a single composition. The resulting composite image often depicts people or objects in implausible, improbable, or impossible circumstances, such as a 21st-century man in an 18th-century city, or a castle in the clouds. Another slightly more practical application of the technique is to integrate photos of landscapes or backgrounds with lighting or other visual aspects that are generally technically or physically unachievable.
While this technique may sound relatively uncomplicated in our current technology-driven world, it was a different story when the composite image was first created in the mid-1800s. Artists and photographers began toying with the layering effect by literally cutting, gluing, and juxtaposing photos and paintings together to market and memorialize large social events. As society moved into the World War I era, the process utilized the virtual reality effect to create scenes of soldiers with their loved ones, as well as propaganda for the war effort.</span>

By any measure, MongoDB is a popular document-oriented JSON database. In the last dozen years, it has grown from its humble beginnings of a single lock per database to a modern multi-document transaction with snapshot isolation. MongoDB University has trained a large number of developers to develop the MongoDB database.
There are many JSON databases now. While it&#x27;s easy to start with MongoDB to learn NoSQL and flexible JSON schema, many customers choose Couchbase for performance, scale, and SQL. As you progress in your database evaluation and evolution, you should learn about other JSON databases. We&#x27;re working on an online training course for MongoDB experts to learn Couchbase easily. Until we publish that, you&#x27;ll have to read this article. :)</span>

                    <span>First of all, do not let the title deceive you — it will not be simple println(“Hello world”) but with Actor System. Today, we will implement your first (sorry if I assumed wrongly) video streaming service. Namely, I will use Akka HTTP and Streams to create a REST API capable of streaming a video file, in mp4 format, in a way that matches the expectations of HTML5  tag. Besides, I will also add a few words about Akka and some components like Akka Streams to give you some theoretical background before you start coding. But first, one question.
Why Video Streaming?
There are three main reasons behind choosing video streaming as the topic for today’s article. The first one is that it is an absorbing and complex subject for me, especially on a large scale (like Netflix) and I have always wanted to learn more about it. The next reason is that it is a niche topic, so a project based around video streaming can be a great addition to anyone&#x27;s portfolio - this one is especially important for people who want to start their journey with Scala and Akka. Last but not least it is very interesting way to get familiar with Akka Streams, which in fact makes this whole operation much easier.</span>

                    <span>This blog will guide you through the basic understanding of extractors in Scala.
An extractor is an object that has a method. It takes an object as an input and gives back arguments. Custom extractors are created using the &quot;unapply&quot; method. The method is called extractor because it takes an element of the same set and extracts some of its parts. The method, also called injection, acts as a constructor, takes some arguments, and yields an element of a given set.</span>

                    <span>One of the most fascinating aspects of Adobe Document Generation is how incredibly flexible it is. One aspect of the API that can really enhance the final result is the ability to include images in your template. In a typical use case, you would provide a static image defined in your data used with the API. In this blog post I’m going to demonstrate a more advanced example — dynamically generating images, in our case, charts, on the fly.
The Basics
Before we get into a more advanced demo, let’s quickly cover the basics. (My coworker has a very deep look into Document Generation and images you should check out as well.) As our docs describe, using a dynamic image in your Word template requires a few steps.</span>

                    <span>Introduction
Third-party scripts can cause negative load-time effects. Why is this an issue? Well, in Google’s view, a poorly-optimized page should not rank highly. Instead, search results should favor pages with fundamental design strengths—including JavaScript minification, rapid execution time, and render-friendly scripting. 
In reflection of this belief, Google has planned the gradual release of a major update to its search algorithm that is scheduled for June through August of 2021. This update will increase the importance of a page’s loading speed as a contributing factor to a web page’s overall ranking on Google’s search results page.  As a result, how third-party scripts impact page load times is becoming more important than ever.</span>

This article discusses the journey Kafka users have taken to get on the API bandwagon and how developers are using contracts to describe brokers without losing control of their data in the cluster. A critical component for effective schema governance is having a schema registry such as Apicurio Registry.</span>

Or let’s have a look at another situation: a new feature that changed the business process was developed and tested according to the best software practices, but users struggle to use this feature because they are not sure about the changes this feature brings. Maybe a proper user manual or user training is needed in this case?</span>

                    <span>Today, every business wants to deliver high-quality, easy to use and accessible applications to all sections of society. Delivering seamlessly accessible apps to one and all is not only a requirement for all businesses but is also societal responsibility that should be taken care of.  
To ensure inclusivity to differently-abled populations of the society, every socially responsible organization should deliver applications and products that are accessible to one and all, including people with visual, hearing, cognitive, and motor limitations. The apps should also be user-friendly and must deliver a great UX. This is where accessibility testing and usability testing comes into the picture. Let us now try to understand both of these testing types in more detail in the form of a detailed comparison.</span>

                    <span>In this article, we look at object-to-object mappers in C# .NET.  Mappers solve the common problem of writing mundane and repetitive code when assigning values between objects.  Three different mapping libraries are evaluated to give an idea of common themes and some differences which might be relevant for your development needs.
The mapping libraries AutoMapper, AgileMapper, and Mapster have been used in a simple demo program to explore some simple mapping scenarios.</span>

                    <span>The Jakarta EE Ambassadors are encouraged by the continued progress and relevance of both Jakarta EE and MicroProfile. We believe a clear, collaborative, and complementary relationship between Jakarta EE and MicroProfile is very important for the Java ecosystem. 
Unfortunately the relationship has been unclear to many in the Java community, sometimes appearing to be disconnected, overlapping and competitive. MicroProfile builds on top of some Jakarta EE specifications and many Jakarta EE applications now use MicroProfile APIs. For the success of both, it is imperative that the technology sets clarify alignment to ensure continuity and predictability.</span>

                    <span>In the previous article, I described the creation of an HTML table report with AJAX filtering and user sorting of columns — using a few lines of code written into a single Java command. For this, I used the ReportBuilder class from the Ujorm framework. Today, I’d like to show you how to place formatted content into the cells of such a table, as well as a few more improvements. What will the final table look like?
Our filter now has a new input field for limiting the number of displayed rows. We can insert the first column into our table, containing the sort order number of the row. The star classification of a hotel can be displayed using a list of appropriate characters with a tooltip, and the final column contains a link to the hotel home page. The original behaviour of the table remains the same, the updated source code is here:</span>

The correct way to fix this would be to create a Pull Request. But your deadline is tomorrow: you need to make it work now! It&#x27;s time to hack the provided API.</span>

                    <span>There are plenty of failure possibilities with Scrum. Given that Scrum is a framework with a reasonable yet short “manual,” this effect should not surprise anyone. To make things worse, a crucial success factor of every Scrum team is not even mentioned in the Scrum Guide: Any organization that wants to employ Scrum to learn faster than its competitors needs to have a solid failure culture.

                    <span>It&#x27;s time to have some fun. Sure, tell your colleagues or your family that you&#x27;re doing research, experimenting with some new tech—because that is what we&#x27;ll be doing—but just don&#x27;t let them see you playing Minecraft!
Here&#x27;s the scenario: You&#x27;re organizing a full-day Minecraft class for local STEM students. You need to run your own Minecraft servers to ensure a kid-friendly multiplayer environment, restricted only to your students. One server won&#x27;t be enough, so you&#x27;ll run two servers simultaneously, expecting your load balancer to handle sending students to Server A or Server B, depending on the load.</span>

                    <span>Amongst various metrics that Kafka monitoring includes consumer lag is nearly the most important of them all. In this post, we will explore potential reasons for Kafka consumer lag and what you could do when you experience lag.
Kafka — Past and Present
Apache Kafka is no longer used just by the Internet hyperscalers. Apache Kafka is used in the enterprise to deal with exploding streaming data. It powers compelling consumer experiences such as real-time personalization, recommendation and next best action. Kafka allows low latency ingestion of large amounts of data into data lakes or data warehouses. Kafka allows businesses to get real-time intelligence into their business operations that allows them to react in real time to changing business conditions.</span>

                    <span>Introduction
Using &quot;sys.objects,&quot; we can get a list of tables and stored Procedures created in the Database. SQL Server now supports table-valued parameters, which allow us to send data tables as parameters to Stored Procedures. It still uses the same ADO.NET API. Using SYSOBJECTS and SYSDEPENDS, we can get all the tables, stored procedures, and other database object-related information.
Description
You can apply the OBJECT_ID, OBJECT_NAME, and OBJECTPROPERTY() built-in functions to the objects shown in sys.objects. It contains a row for each user-defined, schema-scoped object that is created within a database. sys.objects does not show DDL triggers because they are not schema-scoped. Table Valued Parameter allows a table (i.e multiple rows of data) to be passed as a parameter to a stored procedure from T-SQL code or from an application. It was not possible to pass a table variable as a parameter to a stored procedure in old versions of SQL Server.</span>

                    <span>This article is about the prospects of IoT and why we need to build IoT projects. You may think the reason is new technologies like 5G but that is not the case. After the pandemic of last year, we witness an unprecedented usage of the internet and heavy reliance on network-based applications. Today, in 2021, we can say that consumer behavior has changed and it has changed for good. Consumers start relying on IoT devices and that&#x27;s why you need to build one today. Here is why.
Technology Diversity Drives IoT Growth
The Covid-19 pandemic drove companies and consumers to become more technology-reliant. No wonder the IoT grew by double-digit. We witness increasing sophistication of the IoT technology and this trend is going to dominate in the upcoming years. In this part, we will talk about some of the challenges and advantages of technology when it comes to IoT.</span>

                    <span>Background
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) tells us the whole story just by its name — these are exposures and vulnerabilities that are common. But what happens when uncommon issues are discovered and exploited by attackers? What if attackers just want us to think they’d only exploit common issues and vulnerabilities?
Securing CVEs sounds like it should be the right place to start from. Exploring common vulnerabilities and exposure is where script kiddies start from, that&#x27;s what bots are exploiting, and none of us want to end up in the security hall of shame, set aside for organizations that were exploited and affected by ransomware, thanks to an unpatched CVE from months ago.</span>

                    <span>Five years ago, wireless ISP partners were roughly seven to eight miles on average away from their typical subscribers in rural areas. In the last three years of progress since then, wireless ISP partners say they&#x27;re really between three to five miles from their subscribers in rural areas. This means they&#x27;ve been putting a concerted effort of getting closer to these subscribers to provide more serving points to get more capacity and more speed to the subscribe.
Those familiar with the fixed wireless business know that it is traditionally made up of backhaul equipment that delivers bandwidth at a low cost from data centers and tower locations into neighborhoods.</span>

                    <span>Object-Oriented Programming and Design principles have now existed for over 50 years, so it seems odd that apparently, no one has noticed the substantial flaw in Object-Oriented Design that has existed since the very beginning. We are instead told that Object-Oriented (OO) Design principals have won the day, as they provide a programmatic mirror image of the real-world scenarios they are intended to reflect. If we look a little deeper, OO Design is in fact completely detached from the world that it is intended to model. Whilst it is obviously true that the world consists of objects — known and unknown, real and abstract — the unimaginable flaw in OO Design fundamentals that seems to remain undetected until this day is that calling objects can never have complete mastery of the Interfaces of the objects they call: objects can only ever be masters of their own Interface — of themselves.
Example
Let’s imagine a Customer Object in negotiations with a SalesContact Object, in any given IT Landscape. OO Design asks us to pretend that the Customer Object has perfect mastery of the SalesContact Object Interface, and therefore knows exactly how to call the relevant RequestQuotation method of the SalesContact Object: having already guessed at the name of that method, its latest publicly-available version, and based upon the false hope that the definition of the RequestQuotation method will not change over time. The obvious reality is that the Customer Object can only guess at the Interface of the SalesContact Object, and hope that this Interface does not change in the short-term (e.g. as the product range offered by the SalesContact becomes more developed, and therefore more complex). Add to this the fact that the very same Customer Object may need to exchange with several different SalesContact Objects in several different departments, not all using the same Interface Version or even the same Interface — the same API — and we must consider that the OO Design philosophy, as it stands today, is massively flawed.</span>

                    <span>Understanding Canary 
Canary was an essential part of British mining history: these humble birds were used to detect carbon monoxide and other toxic gases before the gases could hurt humans (the canary is more sensitive to airborne toxins than humans). The term “canary analysis” in software deployment serves a similar purpose. Just as the canary notified miners about any problems in the air they breathed, DevOps engineers use a canary deployment analysis to gauge if their new release in CI/CD process will cause any trouble to business.
You can consider the following general definition of a canary release deployment: canary deployment is a technique to reduce the risk of introducing a software update in production by slowly rolling out the change to a small subset of users before making it available to everybody.</span>

                    <span>Azure Synapse Analytics is a new product in the Microsoft Azure portfolio. It brings a whole new layer of control plane over well-known services as SQL Warehouse (rebranded to SQL Provisioned Pool), integrated Data Factory Pipelines, and Azure Data Lake Storage, as well as add new components such as Serverless SQL and Spark Pools. Integrated Azure Synapse Workspace helps handle security and protection of data in one place for all data lake, data analytics, and warehousing needs, but also requires learning some new concepts. At GFT, working with financial institutions all over the world, we pay particular attention to the security aspects of solutions that we provide to our customers. Synapse Analytics is a welcome new tool in this area.
The New Workspace Portal
The first visible difference, when compared to other services, is that Synapse Analytics has a separate Workspace: https://web.azuresynapse.net/ that provides access to code, notebooks, SQL, pipelines, monitoring, and management panels. The portal is available on the public Internet using Azure AD Access controls for controlling access to any Synapse Analytics instance in any tenant that we have access to. However, Synapse Analytics introduces a new way to connect to the portal from Internet-isolated, on-premises networks, and offices using Private Link Hubs. Compared to Private Links that protect access to services and databases, this solution is used for routing traffic to a web portal. In conjunction with the Azure AD Conditional Access policy, the new Synapse Analytics Workspace can be protected with network and authentication policies.</span>

                    <span>You might have previously used observability tools such as Prometheus, Azure Monitor, AWS Container Insight, or commercial products such as Logic Monitor to monitor your Kubernetes cluster. Let&#x27;s probe the Kubernetes magic that makes the beautiful CPU and memory dials tick on the monitoring dashboards.
Kubernetes has a built-in Metrics API (see spec) and a simple CLI query, kubectl top ( documentation), that you can use to fetch a snapshot of the CPU and memory consumption of a Kubernetes object. The Kubernetes Metrics API is dependent on the Metrics Server cluster add-on that gathers resource usage from the Kubelets of the cluster. The primary consumer of the Metrics API is the Horizontal Pod Autoscaler. The Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) uses the metrics served by the Metrics API to scale the number of pods based on the observed resource metrics values. Apart from the Metrics API, HPA is designed to also consume metrics from your application running on the cluster (custom metrics) and services outside the cluster (external metrics) to autoscale pods. Some examples of external metrics provider to HPA are the popular open-source events-based autoscaling service KEDA and soon Logic Monitor. Similar to HPA, Vertical Pod Autoscaler (VPA) relies on Metrics Server as well. VPA allows you to automatically scale the CPU and memory constraints of the containers in a pod.</span>

                    <span>Introduction
A spreadsheet is a particularly useful way to display and exploit tabular data, or just formatted content. Generally, the user will fill in data simply by typing it and modify the properties of cells using the sheet controls.
However, some data types can be challenging for free typing. A date can be easily misinterpreted if the format is incorrect for example. Or you may need the user to freehand a signature before printing.</span>

                    <span>This article contains step-by-step information on running the Mule Application in AWS. Here, Terraform will be used for provisioning AWS resources. Terraform code will help to create an EC2 instance with required inbound and outbound rules and a key pair for logging into the instance, then running script that will set up the run time environment for our Mule Application. Mulesoft has a runtime manager, i.e., CloudHub that can be used to deploy or manage the mule application in a more scalable way. Basically, CloudHub is using the AWS EC2 instance that they call workers in CloudHub to run client applications, though it offers really cool features like proxies, SLAs and etc. The purpose of this tutorial is just to show you an alternative way of running Mule application and After deploying to AWS, You will get a public endpoint for your application that can be tested with any rest client.

                    <span>Being able to remotely collaborate on code with your colleagues has never been as essential as it is today. While ad-hoc screen sharing is okay for infrequent use, its capabilities fall far short for longer, more regular sessions. We move then, to code focused, IDE based solutions - there are several of these, but there are very few which support collaboration across multiple IDEs, and only CodeTogether supports Eclipse, IntelliJ and VS Code. This is what we’ll be using to get a collaborative session going, and through this tutorial,  I’ll give you a quick walkthrough of some of its capabilities.  
Installing the Plugin / Extension and Signing Up
CodeTogether can be easily installed from your IDE’s marketplace (IntelliJ, Eclipse, VS Code) - bring up the marketplace dialog from within the IDE, search for and install CodeTogether.</span>

                    <span>This Zato how-to is about ensuring that only API clients with valid SSL/TLS certificates, including expected certificate fingerprints or other metadata, can invoke selected REST endpoints. In this way, we are making access to the endpoints secure and, at the same time, we can guard against a class of faults related to the Certificate Authority infrastructure. 
Overview
Given that in front of all Zato servers in a cluster is a load-balancer, it is the load-balancer that accepts API client connections.</span>

                    <span>In this blog post, we will discuss how you can create a minimalistic raw Ubuntu image using Packer and then deploy it on a bare-metal server using the provisioning engine, Tinkerbell.
What is Packer?
Packer by HashiCorp is an awesome tool to create pre-configured machine images which can be directly used to create an instance. This should not be seen as a replacement for other configuration tools like Ansible, Chef, etc. Instead, you can use the same tools to pre-configure your image, and with Packer, you can automate the management of your machine images like pushing to an image repository or ensuring your CI pipelines have updated images. Packer also helps you to create parallel builds, i.e you can create multiple images for different platforms using a single template. This enables you to ensure changes in your applications can be tested on multiple platforms simultaneously. It can also be seen as a factor to reduce the parity between developer and production builds.</span>

                    <span>With every business becoming a digital enterprise, the ability to rapidly deliver reliable applications is now a core strategic advantage. Are Fortune 500 and equivalent organizations prepared for the digital race ahead? The answer may lie in their software testing process, which can be either a curse or catalyst to speedy innovation.

                    <span>Introduction
Over the last two decades, many application development teams have adopted Agile development practices and have immensely benefited from it. Delivering working software frequently, receiving early feedback from customers and having self-organized cross-functional teams led to faster delivery to market and satisfied customers. Another software engineering culture, called DevOps, started evolving towards the middle of this decade and is now popular among many organizations. DevOps aims at unifyin…</span>

                    <span>For decades, enterprises have developed business-critical applications on various platforms, including physical servers, virtual machines, and cloud environments. The one thing these applications have in common across industries is they need to be continuously available (24x7x365) to guarantee stability, reliability, and performance, regardless of demand. Therefore, every enterprise must be responsible for the high costs of maintaining an infrastructure (e.g., CPU, memory, disk, networking, etc.) even if ac…</span>

Being able to view products and pages liked by other users is not only an interesting exercise, but also a nearly ubiquitous marketing tool — and, it can be easily implemented with MySQL using Arctype.
Nearly every dynamic website uses collaborative filtering to maximize users&#x27; exposure to a wider range of potentially relevant content.  You&#x27;ve seen it on Amazon:</span>

                    <span>Postgres offers set operators that make it easy to query and filter the results of searches from your database. Set operators are used to join the results of two or more SELECT statements. These operators are UNION, UNION ALL, INTERSECT, and EXCEPT-each can be used to construct queries across multiple tables and filter for the specific data that you need.
 
 
To return the combined results of two SELECT statements, we use the UNION set operator. This operator removes all the duplicates from the queried resu…</span>

These attacks can threaten not only servers, but other connected confidential information such as cloud services in AWS, Azure, and OpenStack as well.

                    <span>Introduction
My main job is related to mobile advertising, and from time to time, I have to work with mobile application datasets.
I decided to make some of the data publicly available for those who want to practice building models or get an idea of some of the data that can be collected from open sources. I believe that open-source datasets are always useful as they allow you to learn and grow. Collecting data is often a difficult and dreary job, and not everyone has the ability to do it.</span>

Various vendors added Kafka and related tooling to their offerings or provide a Kafka cloud service. This blog post uses the car analogy - from the motor engine to the self-driving car - to explore the different Kafka offerings available on the market.

The popularity of cloud computing is undeniably on the rise and some of the factors contributing to it include scalability, efficiency, flexibility, and reduced IT costs. As the popularity rises, however, there is a worrying Cyber Security Trend that has emerged for organizations and individuals alike.
According to the 2020 Trustwave Global Security Report, the volume of attacks on cloud services has doubled in 2020 as compared to the last year. Cloud environments are now the third most targete…</span>

                    <span>Introduction
I think there are two concepts that are really fundamental: number one, your architecture for your applications will change over time, right?
Your requirements are going to change. You know, what you use for an MVP or a prototype won’t quite be the same thing that you use for, you know, your app with like 400 to 600,000 lines of code with a team of 20 people. Those things are just naturally going to be different from one another.</span>

As competing cogs in one of the fastest-growing industries within the technology sector, data analysis companies are constantly vying for ways to transform raw SQL queries into impactful visualizations faster and more reliably. Suffice to say, visualization is quite an in-demand skill in today&#x27;s increasingly complex world of data.

                    <span>There are plenty of failure possibilities with Scrum. Given that Scrum is a framework with a reasonable yet short “manual,” this effect should not surprise anyone. The Developers Code Fallacy starts with the idea that Developers are rare and expensive and should focus on creating code. Business analysts or customer care agents can talk to customers instead. However, in practice, it has a diminishing effect on a Scrum team’s productivity and creativity. It is a sign for an organization still profoundly stuck…</span>

                    <span>With more companies embracing APIs, they are fast becoming the weak link in the organizational security chain. In our post-Equifax world, APIs still fly under the radar of security professionals, and the future will only bring more incidents unless leaders adopt strategies and tactics to mitigate the inherent “openness” of APIs.
The Equifax breach was the result of a known vulnerability in the Apache Struts web framework but not all exposures are so easily identified and patched. There are numerous potentia…</span>

                    <span>With a mainstream shift toward cloud-native development, more organizations than ever are realizing real benefits as they modernize their architectures with containerized environments. While this move promises to accelerate application development, it also introduces a new set of challenges that occur with a fundamentally altered software delivery pipeline, ranging from security to complexity and scaling.
In DZone&#x27;s 2021 Containers Trend Report, we explore the current state of container adoption, uncover common pain points of adopting containers in a legacy environment, and explore modern solutions for building scalable, secure, stable, and performant containerized applications.</span>

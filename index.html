                    <span>Introduction
My main job is related to mobile advertising, and from time to time, I have to work with mobile application datasets.
I decided to make some of the data publicly available for those who want to practice building models or get an idea of some of the data that can be collected from open sources. I believe that open-source datasets are always useful as they allow you to learn and grow. Collecting data is often a difficult and dreary job, and not everyone has the ability to do it.</span>

The popularity of cloud computing is undeniably on the rise and some of the factors contributing to it include scalability, efficiency, flexibility, and reduced IT costs. As the popularity rises, however, there is a worrying Cyber Security Trend that has emerged for organizations and individuals alike.

I think there are two concepts that are really fundamental: number one, your architecture for your applications will change over time, right?
Your requirements are going to change. You know, what you use for an MVP or a prototype won’t quite be the same thing that you use for, you know, your app with like 400 to 600,000 lines of code with a team of 20 people. Those things are just naturally going to be different from one another.</span>

As competing cogs in one of the fastest-growing industries within the technology sector, data analysis companies are constantly vying for ways to transform raw SQL queries into impactful visualizations faster and more reliably. Suffice to say, visualization is quite an in-demand skill in today&#x27;s increasingly complex world of data.

                    <span>There are plenty of failure possibilities with Scrum. Given that Scrum is a framework with a reasonable yet short “manual,” this effect should not surprise anyone. The Developers Code Fallacy starts with the idea that Developers are rare and expensive and should focus on creating code. Business analysts or customer care agents can talk to customers instead. However, in practice, it has a diminishing effect on a Scrum team’s productivity and creativity. It is a sign for an organization still profoundly stuck…</span>

There are many approaches to this — you can build your own web application and backend that has views allowing customers to filter and analyze data. Alternatively, you can use the embedded analytics capabilities of Looker, Tableau, or Sisense — all of which are large business intelligence tools, with a host of features and connectors into all sorts of data sources.

                    <span>The application of artificial intelligence (AI) is profoundly altering our understanding of DevOps. Most importantly, it is providing the latest form of DevOps that acknowledges the need for intelligently designed applications supported by robust defence (DevSecOps).  
By now, most organizations understand that DevOps is a substantial discipline they must adopt to ensure consistent levels of productivity, efficiency and service delivery, all of which hold weight in these times of heightened uncertainty.</span>

Recently, while re-architecting legacy components in an application, I experienced the same. As more and more developers joined the team, it became a constant routine to make them aware of the design thought adopted in the architecture and how to adhere to it.</span>

                    <span>Apache Kafka is a community-distributed streaming platform that has three key capabilities: publish and subscribe to streams of records, store streams of records in a fault-tolerant durable way, and then process streams as they occur. Apache Kafka has several successful cases in the Java world. This post will cover how to benefit from this powerful tool in the Spring universe.

In a few other cases where the database is either absent or unavailable, Java programmers need to perform computations with Java. Hardcoding, however, involves a heavy workload. A more convenient alternative is the Java data computation layer tool (including library functions). The tool computes data and returns the result set. Here we examine the structured data computation abilities of several Java data computation layer tools.

Turns out that Echelon’s APIs were much worse, leaking a lot of very sensitive personal in…</span>

In my previous post about Node.js — Dependency Management, we looked at the basics of what is Node.js module. How can we use module.exports and require to work with dependencies. How folder dependencies work and why they are useful. We all look at how the Node.js lookup system works to look for dependencies and some basics of NPM.
Today we will continue from that point and see how we use this module system to break down an application into multiple modules. What are the benefits of doing so and…</span>

                    <span>Configuring the database connections pool for the Rails app might not be a straightforward task for many programmers. There is a constraint of max opened connections on a database level. Your server environment configuration can change in time and affect the number of connections to the database required. For instance number of servers you use can change when you autoscale it based on the web traffic. It means that the number of web processes/threads running for Puma or Unicorn servers could change.

Here we are going to talk about how to make an e-learning app for Android and iOS but before this, it is very important to know why e-learning mobile apps are necessary and how they&#x27;re so popular in 2021. 
As we all know that because of COVID-19, the education system faced several challenges. During these times, the EdTech system came to the rescue of the education sector shutdown.

Regardless of whether your IT systems follow monolithic or microservices architecture, they are complex due to the number of moving parts and the challenges they unwittingly pose around management, deployment, and scaling. Log management systems provide DevOps teams and SREs a third eye that helps monitor and improve performance, investigate errors, visualize events as they occur, and help them lo…</span>

                    <span>Developers are working with new applications every day using Apache Kafka as the backbone to implement an event-driven architecture (EDA) to support distributed systems. However, this adds new challenges when sharing across teams, even within the same organization. What endpoints are available? What is the structure of the message? That’s why payload examples became critical to speed up development. For this reason, having a reliable and enterprise-grade service to mock Apache Kafka should be an item in you…</span>

It’s often the case that vulnerable groups are the first to benefit from new technological advances, and that has held true for the evolution of IoT devices. Many of the solutions available in the market today can be practical for the general consumer, but they truly shine when used to help senior citizens and other vulnerable groups live safer and more independent lives.

                    <span>There is a price for everything, and the loss of privacy is the price for downloading and using apps on smartphones. As security technologist and cryptographer Bruce Schneier, aptly observes, walking around with a smartphone is like carrying a tracking device 24/7.
The smartphone revolution also brought on app development, with contemporary life revolving around mobile applications. This is especially true for Millennials and Gen Zers, whose desire for information at the press of a button remains unchanged …</span>

                    <span>Introduction
In the last article, we described a list of checks which can determine if a system is compromised or hacked.  In this article, we will talk about preventive steps (especially infra-related) that can be taken care of to avoid hacking or to make the system more secure. There are many directions in which we can secure our application as follows:
OS Hardening (Infra Level Security).
Secure Coding Guidelines.
Encryption Of Sensitive Data.
Ensure No Vulnerability Exists in System.

                    <span>Introduction
As in my previous blog where I explained how I came to know if my system is hacked or compromised (link here). Here in this blog, I will explain what basic things we can check on our system when we have doubt if our system is compromised.
This blog has 3 parts. In this part, we look at a list of checks which can determine if a system is compromised or hacked.</span>

                    <span>As we all know and firmly believe, applications and infrastructures need to be secured, but the shipping processes of this whole ecosystem also need to be.
In a previous article, we introduced GitOps as a methodology to improve the velocity of the development and the management of an entire infrastructure. But there are many other benefits from GitOps, and one of them is the potential improvement of security.</span>

This is a clear indication of how microservices are currently driving the market, encouraging organizations to break their applications into smaller components and leave their &quot;traditional&quot; monolithic architecture behind.

The performance, possibility to replay events and multiple consumers independently were some of the features which disrupted the streaming arena.
But Kafka has been also known for its difficult learning curve and difficulties with the operation. In my experience, both things are improved a lot in the last few years but the original gotcha…</span>

Despite our best efforts, the database will accept plenty of garbage data if you let it. There are tons of methods to bypass the Rails callbacks and validations while still updating your database. If you are like me you have probably used these methods in the Rails console to fix some of that funky data you found after some other code created it in the first place.

                    <span>Cross-browser testing has become an integral part of the test process to ensure the product experience and behavior remain consistent across different combinations of web browsers, devices, and operating systems. As testing has to be performed on varied combinations, it can lead to code duplication as a lot of test methods will be doing the same thing but on different input combinations. I have come across many such situations during the code optimization process when I felt that a part of the code is eithe…</span>

                    <span>Microservices, or generally called microservice architecture, the architectural platforms that come out from the world of continuous development, scalable systems, decoupled applications, and polyglot programming. It segregates the platform with the aid of service boundaries, which makes it simpler to employ and manage each service individually. As every component is independent of each other, adding up advanced features or scaling solutions becomes a lot effective and easier.

Testing an asset is a crucial phase for most human activities. As humans, we are able to define very complex algorithms and to design intricate domains with several different possible states. There are no boundaries on what we can create and design. On the other side, as humans, we make mistakes. It represents the main friction to our creativity. Usually, during a creative activity, questions like the following may arise:

That&#x27;s because we live in a highly competitive world where, in order to become a leader, organizations need a differentiator that sets them apart. That could mean presenting new services, better user experience, different approaches for different audiences, finding new channels to convey their message, keeping their audience engaged in a consistent manner, and more.

                    <span>As you create resources in a Kubernetes cluster, you may have encountered the following scenarios:
 
 
No CPU requests or low CPU requests specified for workloads, which means more Pods “seem” to be able to work on the same node. During traffic bursts, your CPU is maxed out with a longer delay while some of your machines may have a CPU soft lockup.
 
 
Likewise, no memory requests or low memory requests specified for workloads. Some Pods, especially those running Java business apps, will keep restarting whi…</span>

                    <span>Introduction
There is a rise in industry-specific data analytics solutions because building up and maintaining custom data warehouses is difficult. It requires extensive development and operational efforts to define the appropriate industry-specific data model for the business intelligence tools, follow all the shape changes over time (new tables, new columns, new relationships) and design the ETL processes for a wide variety of data sources. It is just hard to build a solution on top of a generic data ware…</span>

                    <span>Introduction
Spring security provides a mechanism to control and limit the maximum number of single-user open sessions. This mechanism prevents users from exceeding the number of allowed simultaneous connections.

As consumers, we perceive value based on how much we can decode the ingredient labels and match it to the price at which it is offered. While it’s easy to relate an ingredient like refined sugar to unhealthiness, it’s another thing to rightly estimate the hidden price that you pay for consuming that sugary food.

Earlier, this management of IT infrastructure was done manually by the system administrators. They managed all the hardware and software that was required for an application to run. Tech has progressed a lot in the past few years, and now there is an alternative to this manual management, called Infrastructure as Code or IaC in short.</span>

Neural Nets have become pretty popular today, but there remains a dearth of understanding about them. For one, we&#x27;ve seen a lot of people not being able to recognize the various types of neural networks and the problems they solve, let alone distinguish between each of them. And second, which is somehow even worse, is when people indiscriminately use the words Deep Learning when talking about any neural network without breaking down the differences.

In relational database systems, SQL is more than a declarative query language. It includes procedural language (T-SQL, PL/SQL, etc) and defines transactions and their semantics. SQL as a query language has been unreasonably effective even in NoSQL database systems. However, few NoSQL database systems support transactions.

                    <span>Lead developers are the main people behind product development. They have a unique perspective and insight to share with those who are looking for career advice. So, I decided to start interviewing CTOs and Lead Developers instead of CEOs and CMOs, all of whom have had their own diverse career paths before arriving at this position.

                    <span>Today I’d like to show you a simple table HTML report created with only thirteen lines of source code, written in a single command line using the Java programming language. Let’s pretend the data provision service already exists. If we wanted to offer our users some simple (sequential) content filtering for a table with column sorting, our implementation will have to add a few extra lines of code. To optimize this filtering, we’ll need to dig deeper into the backend. The web component takes its data from an…</span>

                    <span>Whether you rely on them for business or personal use, it’s safe to say that we interact with URLs on a daily basis. They are our gateway to provide and access information across the web, and due to their universal nature, they are constantly scrutinized by attackers for security vulnerabilities. One type of risk that can be difficult to identify is if your URL is a server administration path; if it is, it could become a potential target for remote access attacks. To clarify, server administration paths are…</span>

                    <span>One powerful feature of Microsoft SQL Server is common table, which lets you store a temporary result and execute a statement after using that result set. This can be especially helpful when trying to accomplish complicated processes, like those that SQL Server isn’t well suited to handle. CTEs make challenges easier to solve by breaking difficult operations into two distinct steps.

For example, you can dive right into the console, or use approaches like Chalice or the Serverless Framework, to name a few. For me, the latest way, announced at re:Invent 2020, is the most efficient way of testing your serverless function locally and dealing with large or awkward dependencies in your code. As you’d expect, this works perfectly with AWS SAM. This post will give you a quickstart into wha…</span>

But these feelings start to wane when stakeholders try to figure out the cost of getting the project from 0 to 100.

                    <span>In our series of chaos engineering articles, we have been learning to simulate various performance problems. In this post, let’s discuss how to simulate a StackOverflow error. A StackOverflow error is a runtime error. In this post, we&#x27;ll simulate a StackOverflowError, diagnose it, and solve the problem.
Sample Program
Here is a sample program from the open source BuggyApp application, which would generate java.lang.StackOverflowError.</span>

I&#x27;ll be using Python code examples, but you can easily adapt this tutorial to your language of choice.

According to IDC, global spending on artificial intelligence systems is forecast to reach €31 billion in 2019, a 44% increase from 2018 spending.

Contrary to logs and observability, which shows what happens on a service, tracing allows developers and operators to follow a specific request and how it calls different services and dependencies. It is designed around microservices architecture, which—unlike monolith architecture—uses many small services to run a platform. These services communicate with each other as well as with…</span>

Latest Tag Is Broken at Best, Evil at Worst
It seems like the “latest” tag should work, but it really doesn’t, except in the simplest cases. We didn’t realize how crazy broken this could be until one night we were on a Zoom call and watched a new customer install software that was three months old, when there were 10 newer builds available.

However, even if you have a small number of records, let’s say less than 100,000, it would be almost impossible to sift through them one by one by one, and perform such a comparison.

Firstly, of course, we have to initialize our string. What is a string used for?
You want to look at your string as a line, not as a mass of symbols.
If you have a long text, you want to work with the words, not the letters.
If you have lots of information, you need functions that solve questions as quickly as possible.

                    <span>Losing any kind of confidential data is a high-risk security concern for all businesses. Especially people who run online businesses, or most commonly freelancers, often find themselves in situations where they are required to share private information, such as medical records and credit card information with their respective foreign clients. This private information, if compromised, can have catastrophic consequences on businesses and freelance careers, both from a legal and publicity point of view.

An important concept in Node.js is that you want to know the way dependency management is handled. This dependency management is part of the core Node.js experience. In this post, we will learn the various patterns of dependency management and how Nodejs load dependencies.
So, we could write our application using a single js file for everything, but that’s not modular. Node.js makes it very simple to write modular code.</span>

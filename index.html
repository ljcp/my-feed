                    <span>There are many ways an organization practicing DevOps can capture value with a software product or service. These range from giving it amazing features to providing troubleshooting tips and instant in-built support when a software system malfunctions.
DevOps brings development and operations teams together to deliver maximum value in the shortest time possible. As this string of activities eventually benefits the customer, they can be considered a value stream.</span>

                    <span>Azure DevOps UI provides an option to trigger multiple days or once a week. We know that many times we need to execute Azure DevOps pipeline triggers once a month, or twice a month, and this can be done using Cron Expressions in Azure DevOps.
Azure DevOps uses NCronTab to evaluate cron expressions, so advanced expressions are not fully supported by Azure DevOps. However, most of the expression is supported so it does the job.</span>

                    <span>A single database server for a small set of applications and data has historically worked well. However, when exposed to a large, public user base, the only way to increase the capacity of these servers is to upgrade them to a more expensive server.
To improve capacity, move the database software to another single machine with more memory, more disk space, and more processors. This is &quot;vertical scaling&quot;. The drawback to this approach is that it may require downtime. There&#x27;s also a ceiling on the performance that can be obtained from a single machine.

                    <span>This brief intro to several geospatial data concepts covers spatial databases, spatial indexing, and using GeoJSON data in NoSQL.
What Is Spatial Data?
Spatial data are data types (files, databases, web services) that encode geographic information for use in location-aware applications.
 
When writing a book on web-based mapping 15 years ago, my readers were forced to learn a stack of mostly new technology. Geographers had to learn the tech and developers had to learn the domain. That included web servers, SQL applications, and a bit of PHP. But the big &quot;new thing&quot; was using spatial data. Although more prevalent today, application developers still need to understand how to work with this domain-specific spatial data type.</span>

                    <span>You want to find the right work-life balance — but balance too often implies separating work and life into equal halves, which is nearly impossible to do in an age where they so easily bleed into one another. Who hasn’t booked a vacation from the office, or conversely, responded to a work email on vacation?
The recent shift to remote work has made it even more difficult to keep your personal and professional selves separate. You can no longer rely on a commute or the confines of office walls to divide your lives into parts. If this is really the new normal, your wellness relies on throwing away the notion of life and work as separate halves.</span>

John had prepared for a carefree outdoor outing, like those in his childhood, when he would run around in the grass — but it took a different turn. His outing turned out to be something like a Q&amp;A session that was all about flowers: the students were amazed at John’s ability to recognize flowers, and repeatedly asked him what kind of flowers they encountered. Faced with their sincere questioning and adoring expression, John, despite being a flower novice, felt obliged to give the right answer even though he had to sneak to search for it on the Internet.</span>

Do you know that at this present age, an average person utilizes almost 36 cloud-based services each day? Also, Cloud data centers process nearly 94% of the total workload in 2021. 
A buzzword in the field of information technology was on the tip of the tongue of every living being a decade ago. The topic of discussion for everyone was “the cloud.” People were curious to know what exactly that thing is? Is that different from the internet? Is it safe to use? It is understandable that some of those questions might sound funny in this age, but the reality check is that’s exactly what people used to think years ago.</span>

                    <span>Defining fairness is a problematic task. The definition depends heavily on context and culture and when it comes to algorithms, every problem is unique so will be solved through the use of unique datasets. Algorithmic fairness can stem from statistical and mathematical definitions and even legal definitions of the problem at hand. Furthermore, if we build models based on different definitions of fairness for the same purpose, they will produce entirely different outcomes. 
The measure of fairness also changes with each use case. AI for credit scoring is entirely different from customer segmentation for marketing efforts, for example. In short, it’s tough to land on a catch-all definition, but for the purpose of this article, I thought I’d make the following attempt: An algorithm has fairness if it does not produce unfair outcomes for, or representations of, individuals or groups.</span>

The reason computers can do all of this because all these problems can be expressed as numerical equations, and the computer&#x27;s CPU—its central processing unit—is actually little more than a simple calculator.</span>

People take their mobile devices wherever they go. Mobile devices have become a necessity in people&#x27;s daily routines, whether it be for looking at the weather forecast, browsing news, hailing a taxi, navigating, or recording data from a workout. All of these activities are associated with location services on mobile devices.
With the location awareness capability offered by HarmonyOS, mobile devices will be able to obtain real-time, accurate location data. Building location-awareness into your application can also lead to a better contextual experience for application users.</span>

                    <span>Introduction
In Mulesoft implementation we always come across a need of implementing a robust logging framework that helps development and operation teams monitor and debug transactions in a faster and better way. 
In Mule 4, the JSON Logger makes the effort of such logging framework creation faster and easier. Thanks to Andres Ramirez for releasing such a cool stuff for logging, which is much powerful than out of the box Mule logging component. In this blog we will explore some of these features. The intent of this blog is to demonstrate how the JSON logger can make the implementation of a standard logging framework super simple.</span>

                    <span>Introduction
I have been working around databases for about four decades (that does date me!). From the early days of System R and Ingres, through the commercial engines of DB2 and Oracle, the open sources of MySQL and Postgres, to the current generations of NoSQLs like MongoDB and Cassandra and scalable SQL like CockroachDB and Yugabyte, anyone who has predicted the demise of databases has proven to be wrong. SQL as the query language has persisted, evolved, and improved, but the basic select * from foo where x &#x3D; 1 group by y  is the language known to hundreds of thousands of developers. Why is that? Because databases just work, and how can you say that about too many things?
As a frontend developer, you want to see data in logical business constructs. Say a customer has one or more addresses, then your React application would love to see data like this:</span>

                    <span>Certificates Are Always a Pain in the Production Environment!  
Security is the one the most important part of any application these days especially the fact that most of the applications are running on a public cloud provider puts the security part on a higher priority. One of the ways application are using to keep communications secure is through the certificate. The certificate is one of the concepts that it is not as easy as another part of software development. First, you should understand how a certificate plays in the security part to figure out how to incorporate it into your application security. Moreover, you need to know how to generate/issue a new certificate for your application. 
Unfortunately, certificate generation is not a one-time job and it has expiration date. So, it means a new certificate should be replaced with the current certificate before the expiration date comes. In most cases, the certificate information is used in configurations of a deployed application on production. Therefore, you need to generate a new certificate and redeploy your application on production. This creates difficulties for software teams to see how they can handle this issue and justify the downtime in production. Lack of knowledge and documentation in projects often makes this operation highly error prune. Therefore, there is a high chance that even after a new certificate something fails on production unexpectedly because of misconfiguration. In this article, we are going to see how we can solve this issue without having downtime on production and also any change on the application level.</span>

                    <span>Intro
BULL (Bean Utils Light Library) is a Java-bean-to-Java-bean transformer that recursively copies data from one object to another. It is generic, flexible, reusable, configurable, and incredibly fast.
It&#x27;s the only library able to transform Mutable, Immutable, and Mixed beans without any custom configuration.
This article explains how to use it, with a concrete example for each feature available.</span>

                    <span>Like so many others in the Apache Cassandra community, I’m extremely excited to see that the 4.0 release is finally here. There are many, many improvements to Cassandra 4.0. One enhancement that is more important than it might look is the addition of support for Java versions 9 and up. This was not trivial, because Java 9 made changes to some internal APIs that the most performance-oriented Java projects like Cassandra relied on (you can read more about this here).
This is a big deal because with Cassandra 4.0, you not only get the direct improvements to performance added by the Apache Cassandra committers, you also unlock the ability to take advantage of seven years of improvements in the JVM (Java Virtual Machine) itself.</span>

                    <span>In this post, you will learn how to create an AWS Application Load Balancer (ALB) for your EC2 instances running a Spring Boot application. You will also create an Autoscaling Group (ASG) which will simplify the setup and will automatically scale-in and scale-out.
1. Introduction
A load balancer will make it possible to distribute the workload across multiple EC2 instances. A client application will connect to the load balancer without knowing which EC2 instance will handle the request. Because of this, EC2 instances can come and go without impacting your client requests. It is transparent because of the load balancer. It is easy to scale-out and thus to add more EC2 instances when traffic increases, or to scale-in and reduce the number of EC2 instances in order to reduce costs when traffic gets low.</span>

It is a critical and creative evaluation of the problem so as to propose a solution. It&#x27;s an attempt to carefully craft a superb experience for an end-user.
Things to Do

Unlike the UX exercise for a web application or mobile app, it becomes extremely challenging when the project that you have undertaken is just UX without a tangible prototype for the customer.</span>

There are many business owners who find the dire need to start a business but are short of the fortune that is needed for the investment. However, all of these shortcomings can be overcome when you go for an on-demand service app development. This market is finding a lot of growth both in its services and potential. So, if you want to choose one particular business from it, it is easier. 
Therefore, there is no better time for you to start the business than right now. Let’s go over the reasons:</span>

                    <span>We have a huge codebase of over 700,000 lines of Perl spread across a couple of dozen Git repositories at work. Sometimes refactoring is easy if the classes and methods involved are confined to one of those repos, but last week we wanted to rename a method that was potentially used across many of them without having to QA and launch so many changes. After getting some help from Dan Book and Ryan Voots on the #perl libera.chat IRC channel, I arrived at the following solution.
Gradual Method Renaming
First, if all you want to do is alias the new method call to the old while making the least amount of changes, you can just do this:</span>

We talk a lot about it, but do we have examples of Servant Leader in the world apart from the political and social world? Few examples which come to mind are Steve Jobs, Apple, and Vineet Nayar, ex CEO of HCL.

                    <span>In this article, we will learn how to estimate all possible java objects or primitives. This knowledge is critically important, especially for a production application. You might think that now most of the servers have enough memory that covers all possible application&#x27;s needs. Well, in some sort you are right — hardware, it&#x27;s pretty cheap compared to a developer&#x27;s salary. But still, it&#x27;s pretty easy to meet very consumable situations e.g.:
 
 
Caches especially with long strings.
 
 
Structures with a big number of records (e.g., a tree with nodes built from the huge XML file).
 
 
Any structures that replicate data from the database.
 

In the next step, we begin estimating Java objects from primitive to more complex structures.</span>

                    <span>Introduction
In today’s highly competitive world, software development and automation play a significant role in creating robust software applications for businesses. Additionally, emerging technologies like artificial intelligence and blockchain have given a competitive edge to enterprises. For gaining maximum benefits out of automation testing, testers require hands-on experience in a minimum of one automation programming language. There are numerous programming languages available today, with new ones continuously emerging. No matter which phase you are in, whether starting with automation testing or being an experienced tester planning to learn a new programming language, deciding which language to choose is very critical.
Which Automation Programming Language Is the Best for Testing?
The following list is prepared after considering metrics like recent trends, language popularity, career prospects, open-source projects, and more. As per TIOBE Index 2021 and IEEE Spectrum Magazine, Java, C, and Python are the top three automation programming languages on the list. Following are some of the most preferred languages on the whole entire list.</span>

                    <span>I use this line, or one like it, in a lot of quick demos. Not that it’s not a production-worthy line of code—I just tend to be a bit more explicit on bigger projects.

Let me start with a question: as a leader in tech, are you satisfied with the budget you have? If I had to guess, I&#x27;d say the answer is no. Because of that, calculating the return on investment of the many activities in software development is certainly an invaluable strategy.

In this post, we&#x27;ll offer you a guide about the ROI of TEM (test environment management).</span>

A high abstraction level of contracts for code is APIs. They define an interface that is basically a contract that the producer and consumer of the API agree to use to communicate with each other. Two common forms of APIs are libraries that are used in code and external APIs that are used via HTTP, RPC, etc.
When thinking a bit deeper, contracts consist firstly of functions, methods, or external endpoints and secondly of data, more precisely on data models and data types within the models.</span>

                    <span>Access control is one of the essential features of database management. Starting in late 2019, ClickHouse contributor Vitaly Baranov began to introduce robust, full-featured Role-Based Access Control (RBAC). As a result of this work, which included a huge number of tests implemented by the Altinity QA team, ClickHouse can now rightfully boast enterprise-level access control. Best of all, the commands are all in SQL.
User management is the front gate of RBAC. It controls access to ClickHouse itself. This article digs into new commands like CREATE USER that allow you to create, change, and delete users conveniently. We’ll focus on ways to control authentication for single ClickHouse servers.</span>

WebRTC leverages a set of plugin-free APIs that can be used in both desktop and mobile browsers and is progressively becoming supported by all major modern browser vendors. Previously, external plugins were required in order to achieve similar functionality as is offered by WebRTC.
WebRTC leverages multiple standards and protocols, most of which will be discussed in this article. These include data streams, STUN/TURN servers, signaling, JSEP, ICE, SIP, SDP, NAT, UDP/TCP, network sockets, and more.</span>

MuleSoft announced the general availability of Anypoint Runtime Fabric on Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) and Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) with the v1.8 release. Release 1.8 allows two flavors of Runtime Fabric as follows:
Runtime Fabric with Mule Appliance.
Runtime Fabric with BYOK (Bring your Own Kubernetes).
RTF with Mule appliance is shipped with mule appliance and is packaged with its own Kubernetes. Therefore, it allows enterprises and implementing partners to take advantage of cutting-edge technologies such as Kubernetes and docker without knowing much about them. However, these days, most enterprises are moving towards the cloud and have embraced these technologies.</span>

                    <span>With 71% of Americans getting their news recommendations from social platforms, personalized content has quickly become how new media is discovered. Whether people are searching for specific topics or interacting with recommended content, everything users see is optimized by algorithms to improve click-through rates (CTR), engagement, and relevance. Sohu is a NASDAQ-listed Chinese online media, video, search, and gaming group. It leveraged Milvus, an open-source vector database built by Zilliz, to build a semantic vector search engine inside its news app. This article explains how the company used user profiles to fine-tune personalized content recommendations over time, improving user experience and engagement.
Recommending Content Using Semantic Vector Search
Sohu News user profiles are built from browsing history and adjusted as users search for, and interact with, news content. Sohu’s recommender system uses semantic vector search to find relevant news articles. The system works by identifying a set of tags that are expected to be of interest to each user based on browsing history. It then quickly searches for relevant articles and sorts the results by popularity (measured by average CTR), before serving them to users.</span>

                    <span>As we have discussed in previous articles, while the Word DOCX format is the go-to for creating text documents, it can be insufficient when we enter the web-based territory. When considering formatting for online documents, it is Hyper Text Markup Language (HTML) that emerges as one of the clear winners for applications and websites. This dynamic language utilizes set cues or elements to construct documents that can be transmitted to browsers and presented to end-users as a readable web page. The structure of HTML even allows for the integration of images, interactive forms, and other objects that are more difficult to create with a straightforward Word document.
The Word DOCX format is actually based on a different markup language, XML (Extensible Markup Language).  Microsoft transitioned its most popular programs – Word, Excel, and PowerPoint – to an open standard, XML-based format in the mid-2000s. This move was to create improvements in file size, image compression, and security, as well as to maintain an edge over their competitors. While some users still prefer the older DOC version due to its compatibility with other platforms, the DOCX format is generally the better choice for current word processing projects.</span>

Overview of Software Project Management
Project management refers to the process of applying skills, knowledge, techniques, and tools to project activities to fulfill the requirements of the project. It usually broke down into project management phases, including project initiation, project planning, project execution, project monitoring, and project closure.</span>

What is a Security Operations Center (SOC)?
A SOC is responsible for maintaining, monitoring, and protecting information security in an organization. It is considered a hub of intelligence that gathers real-time information as it streams across the assets of the organization, including servers, networks, and endpoints, and uses it to identify security events and respond to them in an effective and timely manner.</span>

                    <span>Lots of independent developers use GitHub or its equivalents to host their code repositories. And since they&#x27;re simple to use and well understood by the public, that&#x27;s a great idea. But as anyone who&#x27;s ever created a project that attracted a whole lot of attention can attest, the platforms aren&#x27;t well-suited to distributing binaries and other software releases.
In most cases, GitHub projects that post binaries do so by having a single server or VPS get triggered by a webhook to compile whatever binaries the project requires. And that means every time a user tries to download the resultant binaries, they’ll be making requests to that same single server instance. That&#x27;s both inefficient and a recipe for download problems.</span>

A new report on the “State of Cloud Security Posture Management” reveals that 97% of cloud professionals have some level of confidence in how their organization is handling their cloud security. Yet over half of them have experienced a breach in their security, and over one-third replied that they wouldn’t be surprised if their organization made the news for a major failure. This could result not only in a major loss of data and the potential for service downtime, but a loss of reputation as well.</span>

                    <span>What thoughts come to mind when you come across 404/Page Not Found/Dead Hyperlinks on a website? Aargh! You would find it annoying when you come across broken hyperlinks, which is the sole reason why you should continuously focus on removing the existence of broken links in your web product (or website). Instead of a manual inspection, you can leverage automation for broken link testing using Selenium WebDriver.
When a particular link is broken and a visitor lands on the page, it affects that page’s functionality and results in a poor user experience. Dead links could hurt your product’s credibility, as it ‘might’ give an impression to your visitors that there is a minimal focus on the experience.</span>

                    <span>Welcome to this series of blog posts that covers Redis Streams with the help of a practical example. We will use a sample application to make Twitter data available for search and query in real-time. RediSearch and Redis Streams serve as the backbone of this solution that consists of several co-operating components, each of which will be covered in a dedicated blog post.
The code is available in this GitHub repo - https://github.com/abhirockzz/redis-streams-in-action</span>

                    <span>This post explores use cases and architectures for processing data in motion with Apache Kafka in Industrial IoT (IIoT) across verticals such as automotive, energy, steel manufacturing, oil&amp;gas, cybersecurity, shipping, logistics. Use cases include predictive maintenance, quality assurance, track and track, real-time locating system (RTLS), asset tracking, customer 360, and more. Examples include BMW, Bosch, Baader, Intel, Porsche, and Devon.
Why Kafka Is a Key Piece of the Evolution for Industrial IoT and Manufacturing
Industrial IoT was a mess of monolithic and proprietary technologies in the last decades. Modbus, Siemens S7, SCADA, and similar &quot;concepts&quot; controlled the industry. Vendors locked in enterprises by intentionally building incompatible products without open interfaces. These systems still run on Windows XP or similar non-supported outdated operating systems and without security in mind.</span>

                    <span>One of the talks in my current portfolio is Migrating from Imperative to Reactive. The talk is based on a demo migrating from Spring WebMVC to Spring WebFlux in a step-by-step approach. One of the steps involves installing BlockHound: it allows to check whether a blocking call occurs in a thread it shouldn&#x27;t happen and throws an exception at runtime when it happens.
I&#x27;ve presented this talk several times in the previous week, both in its Java version and its Kotlin one. One such presentation was at Javaday Istanbul. After the talk, one of the questions I received was, &quot;How does BlockHound work?&quot; I admit that at the time, I couldn&#x27;t remember. After the surprise had passed, but too late, I remembered it involved a Java agent. But I wanted to go down the rabbit hole.</span>

                    <span>Rocket.Chat is one of the most popular open-source solutions for team communication, written in JavaScript and TypeScript. It has more than 12 million users worldwide and there are over 800,000 server instances deployed that are being used to exchange confidential information and files. My security research team and I discovered critical vulnerabilities in its source code that could have been used by an attacker to take complete control over a server, starting with as little as any user’s email address. 
In this blog post, I investigate these vulnerabilities by first taking a quick look at NoSQL databases, then explain how injections look like in that context. I then analyze the found vulnerabilities and how they can be chained for an exploit. Finally, I give advice on how to prevent such bugs in your applications.</span>

                    <span>SAFe can hurt - but not as bad as a moto crash. : )
 

Why do some people find SAFe to be helpful in empowering teams while others find implementing the Framework painful? To be honest, both scenarios are equally valid.
As I was beginning to refocus my career on transforming the operating models and management structures of large enterprises, I found that the behavioral patterns of Agile and the operational cadence of Scrum shined a spotlight on an organization&#x27;s greatest challenges. As a byproduct of working faster and focusing on flow, impediments became obvious. With the issues surfaced, management had a choice: fix the problems or don’t.</span>

In this post, I&#x27;ll present Kubernetes&#x27;s Operator pattern and how it is implemented in TiDB Operator. More specifically, we&#x27;ll go through TiDB Operator&#x27;s major control loop, from its entry point to the trigger of the lifecycle management.</span>

TypeScript provides good support for both object-oriented programming and function-oriented programming (I’m not saying functional programming as I don’t want the purists to hunt me down).</span>

The Background
At the base of Carbon’s real-time, first-party data platform is our analytics component, which combines a range of behavioral, contextual, and revenue data, which is then displayed within a dashboard in a series of charts, graphs, and breakdowns to give a visual representation of the most important actionable data. Whilst we pre-calculate as much of the information as possible, there are different filters that allow users to drill deeper into the data, which makes querying critical.</span>

                    <span>Large corporations are increasingly longing to be like startups: Flat hierarchies and the absence of formal procedures result in unseen productivity; doing without restraining bureaucracy allows for remarkable speed, innovation, and creativity.
Speed, innovation, and creativity: It&#x27;s exactly these things most corporations are desperately lacking. In turn, it&#x27;s only logical for big companies to want to take a leaf out of the startups&#x27; book. Where the clumsy imitation of a start-up mentality fails or maybe isn&#x27;t even an option, the magic word agile soon echoes through the aisles. Because you know, the competition is already successfully agile, every consultant can deliver ready-made, highly scaled agile wonders on demand in no time at all, and even the house and farm service provider has had experience with it for a long time, but simply wasn&#x27;t asked about it until now. So &quot;agile&quot; gets written on the banner, swarms of self-proclaimed evangelists get unleashed onto the staff and off they go on a journey into a brighter future.</span>

                    <span>Identity theft cases are progressing by leaps and bounds in this modern age of technological advancements. The rate at which fraudulent activities are evolving is directly proportional to the momentum at which technology is progressing. Also, the data production rate is increasing with the progression of the human population. Do you know that 2.5 quadrillion bytes of information are generated each day? 
Considering the rate at which data is produced and utilized all across the globe, the acquisition of sophisticated measures for the protection of such data is something that must not be neglected by enterprises of all sizes at any cost. Keeping in view the swift pace of progression in identity theft cases, robust mechanisms such as real-time identity verification solutions, especially document verification must be incorporated for the enhancement of security protocols and to combat illicit money transfers, counterfeits, chargebacks, and other relevant fraudulent activities.</span>

                    <span>Big data, in recent years, is not just a buzzword, but also a growing need for ambitious companies. With skyrocketing data scale and stringent requirements on data freshness, big data-related scenarios are becoming complicated and multi-dimensional. Thus, many companies use real-time data warehouses to meet their business demand.
But data warehouses are not the only option. An emerging category of databases, Hybrid Analytical/Transactional Processing (HTAP) databases, can serve you just as well as data warehouses, if not better. HTAP databases can handle Online Transactional Processing (OLTP) workloads and respond quickly to big data analytical requests in real time.</span>

                    <span>Introduction
For any application development, reusable assets are more important, which can be shared across the organization&#x27;s application. Based on requirements, it can be enhanced also. Based on my experience and knowledge, I prepare Mule4 logging and error handling framework, which can be more useful and also can get an idea to enhance according to project needs.
Design Logging Framework
Logging is most important while finding production issues, analyzing bugs, change code. It&#x27;s also important to know how a request is being processing and responding back to the caller. I have come across the below 7 areas where we should log information/state of a request.</span>

                    <span>In companies with constant growth and large scale, incidents are inevitable. A robust incident management strategy eventually leads to better management and handling of issues. It is an essential part of reliability engineering, ensuring that a team is prepared to manage incidents. It can prevent the loss of millions of dollars in revenue in times of breaches or downtimes. Good incident management improves customer experience and empowers engineering teams to meet their uptime goals. 
In this blog, we will discuss how companies can identify and prioritize incidents for faster resolution. Incidents could vary a lot on the surface level, and hence it is essential to classify them according to specific, well-defined parameters. All incidents are not equal. For instance, a system outage during peak hours is much more stressful than handling when most customers are asleep.</span>

                    <span>Static code analysis is the practice of examining application’s source, bytecode, or binary code without ever executing the program code itself. Instead, the code under review is analyzed to identify any defects, flaws, or vulnerabilities which may compromise the integrity or security of the application itself. In this Refcard, we explore the necessary components and steps for getting started with static code analysis, including CI/CD integrations, OWASP Benchmark, and more.</span>

                    <span>Developing a Scalable Event Listener for Hyperledger Fabric
Using an event listener for replicating data stored in Hyperledger Fabric ledgers is an emerging pattern in todays’ enterprise solutions based on Hyperledger Fabric oriented distributed ledger technology-based platform. This article will provide a comprehensive guide for building an event listener using Hyperledger fabric-sdk-go. All the examples have assumed the usage of Hyperledger Fabric v2.2.x platform.
Why We Need Event Listeners
For many blockchain-based applications, it has been observed that there is a requirement of storing all or some of the assets into an off-chain data storage. There could be several motivations for such requirements. Some of the frequently encountered cases are</span>

                    <span>A method is a contract; when we define one, we put our thoughts into it. We specify the parameters with their type and also a return type. When we invoke a method, we expect it to behave according to the contract. If it doesn’t, it’s a violation of the contract.
We deal with such a violation all the time. We invoke a method with its proper arguments, and we get a return. However, sometimes we end up getting a null, which is, in fact, a clear violation. We shouldn’t accept such a violation. If a method cannot return the value of the specified type, it should mention that in the method signature, the method may or may not be returning the value you are expecting. If we know it from the method signature, we then write our code accordingly.</span>

                    <span>My ISP is Marco, and I don&#x27;t mean Marco as in Ltd or Inc - No, I mean Marco my neighbour. He lives 200 meters away from me, and serves half the village I live in with internet. A long time ago before traditional ISP companies even bothered to offer internet in the village, Marco installed antennas around the entire village, offered internet services to all who wanted it, and is today the largest ISP in my village. Today of course we&#x27;ve got several huge ISPs in Cyprus, but nobody really care. We&#x27;ve got Marco, and we&#x27;re happy with using his internet. He was there for us when nobody else cared, so why would we want to switch to some huge giga corporation today?
When the big banks stopped allowing people to pay their bills over the counter, Marco stepped in, and is now paying people&#x27;s bills too. Need your bills paid? Drop by at Marco&#x27;s internet store, leave enough cash to cover your bill, add 2 EURO commission on top, and your bills are paid within a day or two. Needless to say, but for the older people in my village, such an offer is precious, since most of the really old people in my village don&#x27;t even know how to pay their bills online.</span>

It&#x27;s an interesting challenge creating architectural content based on common customer adoption patterns. That&#x27;s very different from most of the traditional marketing activities usually associated with generating content for the sole purpose of positioning products for solutions. When you&#x27;re basing the content on actual execution in solution delivery, you&#x27;re cutting out the chuff.</span>

                    <span>Static code analysis is the practice of examining application’s source, bytecode, or binary code without ever executing the program code itself. Instead, the code under review is analyzed to identify any defects, flaws, or vulnerabilities which may compromise the integrity or security of the application itself. In this Refcard, we explore the necessary components and steps for getting started with static code analysis, including CI/CD integrations, OWASP Benchmark, and more.</span>

                    <span>Velocity in agile development measures the quantity of work a team can accomplish in a sprint. It can be measured in story points, hours or days. The higher the velocity of a team, the more features it delivers, the more value it brings to customers. Sprint velocity is a good measure in sprint project management to evaluate and estimate team productivity.
The measure of the velocity is based on multiple factors: the continuous integration (CI) process, the time to qualify the code changes, to test the regression, the security, the delivery, etc…</span>

                    <span>Integration, Events, and Microservice Patterns
Overview
It is intended for architects and developers to use this information to guide their integration solutions. Once an integration style has been selected, they should review the associated integration style section to understand the typical patterns relevant to that integration style, abide by the constraints and review the implementation considerations.
Understanding “Integration” – Applications, Integration, and Microservices
There is an important distinction around the responsibilities of an integration system and applications. Integration facilitates the transmission of information between systems and may be realized through the use of technologies such as messaging systems, API gateways, and their associated protocols (MQ, AMQP, HTTP, FTP). Over the years, many technology vendors have implemented additional capabilities within their integration products that have enabled developers to add business logic embedded within the integration solution. This has resulted in business logic being spread outside of the application layer and integration an integration system that is often managed and maintained by a single team resulting in a resource bottleneck.</span>

What Is an Archetype?
A maven archetype is a templated project. Maven offers several archetypes that allow you to create new maven modules ready to run in few seconds.</span>

The term ZTA has been in use in the domain of enterprise security models and architectures for organizations since 2010 when Forrester coined the term but became popular after NIST published it as a framework (SP 800-207, final version published in Aug. 2020). ZTA further got a lot of visibility after the US govt recently mandated all Federal agencies to adopt ZTA.</span>

                    <span>Almost all APIs have a way of how problems and errors can be reported, making it easier to understand for the API consumer that something went wrong, and what went wrong. How to do that depends on the API style, API technology, and the specific API design. In all these cases, this part of API design needs to be addressed as part of the overall design work.
For APIs using the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), some minimal reporting can be done using HTTP’s status codes. HTTP status codes are interesting because they already provide a certain level of details, with ~60 different codes reporting a variety of conditions which are defined by HTTP itself and a few other specifications.</span>

As the post-digital economy begins to boom and the worlds of business process and technology come together, it’s time to think about how we optimize the whole from a unified, customer-centric perspective. Some organizations have begun to master the idea of experience architecture, whereas others are just beginning.

With that being said, it&#x27;s easy to conclude that AI will have a significant impact on test automation in the coming years. Since faster product releases and great customer experiences define a business’s success, it has become imperative for companies to test their software applications before going to market.

                    <span>What is a Graceful Shutdown?
The Graceful and the Hard (or Abrupt) shutdown are the two methods of stopping an application. When an application is running, it performs certain tasks or processes client requests. While doing so, it consumes various resources, makes connections, persists data, and/or handles transactions, etc. We may want to stop a running application, in order to take it out of the system or to release a different version of the application, as part of the deployment. However, it is important to analyze and understand the consequences of abruptly stopping an application, and such consequences are purely based on the application functionality and its role in the overall system.
In order to explain in detail, the Graceful vs Hard or abrupt stopping of an application is similar to stopping a computer. When we use the shutdown function of an operating system it prompts for any unsaved work or closing of some important applications. In contrast, when we do a Hard shutdown, we lose any unsaved files or unfinished works. Interestingly, the same logic applies to applications. Some applications are capable of resuming any unfinished tasks when they are restarted. Thus, for such applications, abrupt stops don’t cause any harm. On the other hand, for some applications, an abrupt shutdown may result in unwanted outcomes. For example, failure of very large transactions, or opened resources, etc. Thus, while writing an application we should also pay attention to its shutdown procedure.</span>

This post discusses the instances that put a SQL Server 2014 database in recovery mode and what causes the database to get stuck in recovery. Also, it discusses the methods to restore the database. 
You may find a SQL Server 2014 database in recovery mode when you restart the SQL Server service or restore a database from SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS). Also, a database goes into recovery mode if you restart a system abnormally. The database goes into recovery in such a scenario until all the active transactions are committed or rolled back. Let the recovery process complete, and the database comes back online.</span>

Back in the Internet age of the 1990s and the 2000s, there was an idea to make global web navigation easier. It was called a &quot;webring&quot; and it introduced a common section on participating web sites. This common section provided a way to navigate to other sites which contained similar or recommended content.

                    <span>In this highly engaging speaker session from the Agile Camp Berlin 2021, Viktor Cessan shares lessons learned as an Agile coach when working with systems, resulting in evidence-based interventions.
Lessons Learned When Working With Systems
When we, as managers or coaches, are asked to work with a system, there’s always more to a situation than meets the eye. In this presentation, I take you through common requests I’ve gotten as an Agile coach, and I contrast the initial request and understanding with what we discovered was actually going on, and what we did. I also share some tips for anyone working with systems in their day-to-day work.</span>

                    <span>Understanding how to convert between complex file types will allow you to optimize and perfect your operations, ensuring your data is always in the appropriate form. The two formats featured in today’s tutorial are JSON and XML. Both formats are widely used in web-based applications, but one may be more ideal than the other for certain objects. JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) is defined as an open standard file and data-interchange format that uses human-readable text to store and exchange data. It was initially developed from JavaScript, but as a language-independent format it can be used in many different programming languages. Due to its versatility, efficient design, and low cost, JSON has become a go-to for many businesses. 
Our other format, Extensible Markup Language (XML), is similar to JSON in that they both are easy to read, create, and decode. However, XML uses prescribed tags that divide information according to its traits and has limiting factors associated with characters (i.e. !”*(), etc.). While this option may contain a higher word count due to the tags, it does allow for more precision in how data is read by the computer, including improved metadata usability, which is unavailable in JSON.</span>

                    <span>Cybercrime is evolving and increasing in size, ranging from security breaches to identity theft. Cybercriminals target and attack computer networks, servers, and devices through phishing, hacking, SQL injections, man-in-the-middle, DDoS, and malware attacks. They take advantage of common risks or vulnerabilities, such as default passwords or unpatched software.
A study conducted by Accenture shows that there has been a rise of 67% in cybercrime in the last five years.</span>

                    <span>TL; DR: Real Cross-Functional Teams for Creating Real and Better Products — ACB21
In this highly engaging speaker session from the Agile Camp Berlin 2021, Jutta Eckstein and Maryse Meinen point out the advantages of creating diverse, cross-functional teams to benefit your customers and your organization.
The Benefits of Creating Real Cross-Functional Teams
At the core of agile development are self-organizing cross-functional teams. Yet, this is often understood as e.g., backend and front-end developers working together. If an organization is aiming for company-wide agility, to fully benefit from agility it has to enable teams as value centers that are truly cross-functional by bringing in different perspectives from business, markets, cultures, beliefs, etc. This way cross-functional teams overcome not only the limitations of organizational silos but also of a singular view on the market.</span>

                    <span>In recent years, NoSQL distributed databases have become common, as they are built from the ground up to be distributed. Yet they force difficult design choices such as choosing availability over consistency, data integrity, and ease of query to meet their applications’ need for scale.

This Refcard serves as a reference to the key characteristics of distributed SQL databases, how functionality compares across vendors&#x27; offerings, and the criteria for designing a proof of concept.</span>

                    <span>WebAssembly (abbreviated Wasm) is a binary instruction format for a stack-based virtual machine. Wasm is designed as a portable compilation target for programming languages, enabling deployment on the web for client and server applications. At Solo.io, we are very excited about Web Assembly as a way to extend our Envoy Proxy-based API Gateway (Gloo Edge) and the most popular Service Mesh (Istio). We recently made it very easy to use WebAssembly with Gloo Edge and Gloo Mesh.
This is the last blog post of a series about Gloo Edge scalability. In the first blog post, Envoy at Scale with Gloo Edge, we performed benchmarks to determine how Gloo Edge was able to scale in terms of Requests Per Second (RPS.) We also provided information about the throughput one can expect based on the number of CPUs allocated to the gateway-proxy (Envoy) pod.</span>

The purpose of this article is to list tools that everyone should be aware of when it is time to manage a cloud infrastructure. In the cloud, it is obviously better to rely on cloud services offered by the provider but sometimes it is better to use open-source projects to facilitate the management.</span>

                    <span>When you’re providing APIs to your customers, you want to ensure they are getting value from them. At the same time, the best APIs are designed to be fully automated without requiring human intervention. This can leave your customers in the dark on whether your API is even being used by the organization and if you’re meeting any SLA obligations in your enterprise contracts.
Types of metrics to surface
Most API first companies have some sort of developer portal for customers to log into, manage API keys, and customize features. This area is a great way to also expose key metrics to your customers demonstrating how much value they are getting from your API. This can be as simple as a counter showing number of API transactions made within a billing period or provide additional metrics around what those transactions are. Each customer has different metrics they want to look at. Developers will want to look at access logs where as product and engineering leadership are more interested in usage and performance metrics. Finally, the finance department may need to look at billing usage for capacity and financial planning.</span>

                    <span>A strong identity governance strategy enables enterprises to safeguard information, facilitate compliance, and streamline work processes. Despite the benefits, implementing these processes has been perceived as a complex, on-premises project that takes an army of consultants to deploy. While this can be true in some cases, 76% of enterprise organizations are looking to replace their existing identity governance and administration (IGA) system (Gartner). 
This number and other recent research proves we need to find ways to make identity governance more approachable in order for businesses to realize its true value. Fortunately, there are proactive steps companies can take to ensure identity governance is ingrained in their business strategy without the headaches. And it starts with four proactive approaches any business can take to achieve long-term, continual success.</span>

                    <span>So. Many. Databases.
The latest DB-Engines ranking lists 370 databases according to popularity. That’s certainly a lot. And the sheer number may lead some to go back to what they know, or rely on other developers’ recommendations. The more intrepid may even spend some time researching.
Suffice it to say that it takes some navigation to understand the landscape across all the database flavors. And mere understanding doesn’t necessarily lead to the right choice. Martin Kleppman literally maps this out in his noteworthy book, Designing Data-Intensive Appplications, O’Reilly. (Highly recommend this read.)</span>

                    <span>We all go through tough times while transitioning or migration projects in course of our experience. This drove me to write about a similar journey where our agile approach saved a lot of war room situations, and we were able to deliver a similar large-scale migration not once but twice without any problems. Below, I would like to share the same experience where I am going to cover the pain areas and how we were able to overcome the same using our Scalable DevOps Framework. This is also not a baked system or framework as we all know and understand the best fit is a fit that works for a situation. It might be a good starting point, but the end results will matter on a lot of variables.
Key Challenges in Migration
I would like to divide the core challenges into three categories primarily:</span>

                    <span>If your organization has established an efficient CI/CD pipeline and you’ve made a successful transition to DevOps culture, you probably already understand the benefits of doing DevOps. Your teams share information and collaborate efficiently, and you’ve seen measurable increases in software delivery speed and quality. Aside from continuing to do what you’re doing, though, where do you go from here? How can your teams reach the next phase of DevOps maturity?
Once you’re comfortable with continuous integration and continuous delivery practices, the next step is to get really good at progressive delivery.</span>

Dipti has been a tremendous resource for me over the years as she has held leadership positions at Couchbase, Kinetica, and Alluxio.

                    <span>A regular expression is nothing but a sequence of characters that define a pattern which then can be used to filter or match information. This article is not a tutorial on regular expression but shows the versatility of regular expression in our day-to-day life and some useful references.
Data is everywhere and is the new oil for modern generation. Data can be broadly categorized as binary data such as (mp3 file, png file, etc.) which in most cases is not human-readable, whereas text data like emails, notes, etc. are more human-friendly. Regular expression is well suited for searching for content in text data.</span>

                    <span>Ask an SRE to name the most serious threats to reliability, and typos probably won’t feature on the list.
But maybe they should. Sometimes, an errant keystroke is all it takes to bring critical systems offline. And unlike text messages and email, these systems don’t usually have autocorrect tools to step in and save the day.</span>

                    <span>Big Data faces an ironic small file problem that hampers productivity and wastes valuable resources.
If not managed well, it slows down the performance of your data systems and leaves you with stale analytics. This kind of defeats the purpose, doesn’t it? HDFS stores small files inefficiently, leading to inefficient Namenode memory utilization and RPC calls, block-scanning throughput degradation, and reduced application layer performance. If you are a big data administrator on any modern data lake, you will invariably come face to face with the problem of small files. Distributed file systems are great but let&#x27;s face it, the more you split storage layers the greater your overhead is when reading those files. So the idea is to optimize the file size to best serve your use case, while also actively optimizing your data lake.</span>

                    <span>Microservices architecture helps in building an application as a suite of multiple fine-grained smaller services. Each of these services run in its own process and are independently deployable. They may have been developed in different programming languages and may use different data storage techniques and communicate with each other via lightweight mechanisms like RESTful APIs, message queues etc. Now that services(API clients) need to know how to interact with each other, there is a need of API documentation that should be clear, informative, and easy to go through.
OpenAPI makes documenting these RESTful services very easy and can be done by adding few annotations to a Spring-based project. Besides rendering documentation, it allows the API consumers to interact with the APIs without having their own implementation logic in place. Also, it can be used to generate the API client libraries for over 50+ languages. In this post, I’ll cover how to use OpenAPI to generate REST API documentation and Java clients for a Spring Boot project.</span>

                    <span>NoSQL stands for &quot;Not an SQL&quot; The term has been coined many years back, as a result, a number of products have come to the market spanning from key-value to document to columnar to a graph database. MongoDB started its journey as the leading provider of Document DB, a close competitor was CouchBase for reference. There are several languages, a framework which built an out-of-the-box connector for MongoDB just like how JDBC connectors help to connect Java programs to an RDBMS, for example, Mongoose as a module under NodeJS, available through npm and this is one of the key components in MEAN (MongoDB, Express, AngularJS, Node.js) or MERN (MongoDB, Express, ReactJS, Node.js) stacks.
Over the years many such platforms have realized that just having a database will not help to build the platform, the need is to help build a Cloud Native solution with Database-as-a-Service aka DaaS is the future. This means the platform needs to support API as the key enabler to connect to various consumers. The classical way to use an on-premise installation with SDK based connector will not stand long in this &quot;Journey to Cloud&quot; era.</span>

                    <span>The network model for security fails in the cloud. While the old on-prem model made sense in the earlier days of computing, the rapidly expanding suite of cloud providers, along with their infinite combinations of settings and services, now places an extraordinary burden on security teams to become cloud-centric. An enterprise that doesn&#x27;t fully understand its role in securing its data in the public cloud is taking unnecessary risks with its outdated security strategies.
In the traditional data center, the network provided a secure boundary for the organization. The network was carved up into zones and trusts were established within and between zones. Security architectures were established and tools deployed based on this strategy, which largely involved monitoring the traffic flows and enforcing controls where the zones met. But in the cloud, this approach is no longer relevant. Time and again, in breach after breach, headline after headline, the modern attack cycle, particularly in the cloud, starts with identity. Attackers seek access to the identity, then pivot between resources, discovering credentials and other identities that give them more and more access to get what they want.</span>

                    <span>Early Access: Java Concurrency With Project Loom
I am excited about Project Loom. The project focuses on easy to use lightweight concurrency for the JavaVM. Nowadays, the JavaVM provides a one java thread to one OS thread model to the programmer. While it&#x27;s actually the current Oracle implementation, it used to be that many JavaVM versions ago, threads provided to the programmer were actually green threads.
Project Loom goes down that road again, providing lightweight threads to the programmer. Those lightweight threads are mapped to OS threads in a &quot;many-to-many&quot; relationship.</span>

                    <span>CQRS is probably amongst one of the most complex and misunderstood things that exists in software architecture today. In fact, it is so complex, that even &quot;super grandmaster software architects&quot; seems to mess it up sometimes. Having successfully applied CQRS into a software projects that succeeds, and putting it on your resume, might sometimes imply an additional digit in salary as a software architect - At least if you can explain how you did it. To understand why, realise CQRS is the stuff that makes Google tick. In Magic, CQRS is a CheckBox.</span>

                    <span>As is already well established, Graph Databases such as Neo4J are great for intuitively storing relationship data in graph-like structures. Neo4J has been around since 2007 and in its current iteration, it is an extremely robust and versatile NoSQL database framework. But, there are limitations to graph databases, namely:
Query optimization options are limited, although this challenge is certainly being addressed in newer versions.
Data partitioning is a tough proposition, so horizontal scaling becomes challenging.
Computationally intensive or costly queries — most real-world graphs are highly dynamic and often generate large volumes of data at a very rapid rate. One challenge here is how to store the historical trace compactly while still enabling efficient execution of point queries and global or neighborhood-centric analysis tasks.
Queries spanning multiple hierarchies can be time-consuming and not suitable for real-time querying.
Design is only as good as implementation and this is where the human element comes in. Not everyone can think in terms of graphs.
But, the Graph Cache implementation does not seek to address only the shortcomings of Graph Databases. Over and above these things, Graph Cache seeks to provide a performant framework to do the following:</span>

Recently, IBM launched IBM Cloud Satellite. It sure looks like a game-changer in the multi-cloud world. While Satellite is fairly new, this is my attempt with a very basic setup in the IBM Cloud Chennai DC setup.  
With IBM Cloud Satellite, you use your own compute infrastructure that is in your on-premises data center, other cloud providers, or edge networks to create a Satellite location. Then, you use the capabilities of Satellite to run IBM Cloud services on your infrastructure, and consistently deploy, manage, and control your app workloads.</span>

His conclusion? The power and expressiveness of Lisp have conspired to keep its developers individually productive, but collectively unable to organize their work into complete, standardized, well-documented, ‑tested, and ‑maintained packages that they could coalesce into interoperable and widely-adopted solutions. Everything from object systems to types to asynchronous non-blocking programming and concurrency is up for grabs and has multiple competing implementations.</span>

This paper described the concept of distributed application architecture through small self-contained application components deployed across a larger corporate network. Eager to impress my friend, I put down the article and exclaimed: “I know where this is going, microservices.” He smiled and replied, “Look at the published date.” To my astonishment, the white paper was published in the late ’90s on the subject of the then relatively new technology called Enterprise Java Beans (EJB).
Sometime later, I hosted a technology leadership forum at a major insurance company in New York. One of the key discussion points included emerging technologies, and of course, microservices. I used the “EJB” anecdote with a profound (sarcastic) conclusion that software architecture styles and patterns do not drastically change, but rather evolve, while software reference application architecture based on a particular technology stack has a lifecycle of emerging, mainstream, and legacy.</span>

                    <span>Introduction
Financial technology, commonly known as fintech, is one of the most popular areas among software engineering businesses today. Virtually everyone deals with money and payments every day, and creative minds can come up with tons of solutions to improve those interactions. Solutions to people’s finance-related needs—like many kinds of solutions in the modern world—can come in the form of software.
Below is an overview of fintech today showing how diverse and full of opportunities the sector is. The overview can become a source of inspiration for people thinking about investing in fintech or starting a business related to it.</span>

                    <span>Observability is crucial to understanding and adapting your product and your data - and open source telemetry is increasingly important.  To go behind the data and understand where telemetry is going,  Spiros Xanthos joined me on the Dev Interrupted podcast to talk about how data analysis and tracking are changing, and what is next for Splunk. Spiros is the Founder of Omnition and the current VP of Product Management, Observability, and IT at Splunk.

As the Red Hat Summit site explains to us, this &quot;...event is expanding to become an all-new, flexible conference series, consisting of a 2‑part immersive virtual experience as well as a global tour of small-scale, in-person events. This series will create collective opportunities to share experiences, innovations, and insights.&quot;</span>

                    <span>Scrum Master Skills: Visualizing the Tuckman Model
&quot;A picture is worth a thousand words.&quot; Probably, we have all heard that piece of wisdom before. In my experience, having some — even rudimentary — sketching or drawing capabilities is an essential Scrum Master skill. Visualizing a tricky issue while explaining the background to a stakeholder, someone from the management, or a teammate helps to pave the way to have a meaningful discussion.
Let me introduce you to an example sketch based on the Tuckman model of group dynamics I use in my Professional Scrum Master training classes to make the effort and cost of creating a Scrum team easier understandable.</span>

There is a lot of articles over the internet to Integrate HTML reports into Cypress but when it comes to screenshot integration it&#x27;s very difficult and time-consuming. The complexity is more.

                    <span>You want Kafka to stream and process the data. But what comes after you set up the platform, planned the partitioning strategy, storage options, and configured the data durability? Yes! How to stream data in and out of the platform. And this is exactly what I want to discuss today.
The Background
Before we go any further, let’s see what Kafka did to make itself blazing fast? Kafka is optimized for writing the stream data in binary format, which basically logs everything directly to the file system (Sequential I/O) and makes a minimum effort to process what&#x27;s in the data (Optimize for Zero Copy).  Kafka is super-charged at making sure data is stored as quickly as possible, and quickly replicating for a large number of consumers. But terrible at communication, the client that pushes content needs to SPEAK Kafka.</span>

                    <span>Background
To do tests on Nebula Graph, we need to frequently deploy it on servers, so we need a tool to improve the efficiency of deployment. The tool needs to meet these major requirements:
 
 
It can allow a non-root account to deploy Nebula Graph so that we can use groups to limit resource usage.
 
 
It can modify the configuration files on the operating machines and then distribute the configurations to the cluster for testing the parameters.
 
 
It can be called by using scripts to ease integrating it to the testing platform or tool later.
 

About tool selection, there are several options. Fabric and Puppet are veterans and Ansible and SaltStack are rising stars.</span>

                    <span>Evolution of Testing Frameworks
So far, during the development of Nebula Graph, its testing framework has undergone three major changes, as shown in the following figure. In this article, I would like to introduce some experience and lessons that our team has learned from these changes.
For a database product, the importance of testing cannot be overemphasized. Therefore, no matter how the testing framework evolves, it always aims to easily and quickly accumulate test cases to assure stability of Nebula Graph functionalities, not only for developers, but also for its users, including maintenance engineers, documentation engineers, and even non-technical users. To achieve this goal, our testing framework must make codeless programming or no-programming possible for users.</span>

                    <span>To continue building my understanding of Rust, I searched for some simple Rust exercises. Hence, I dedicated my weekly personal work time to the Rustling exercises.
https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings

I believe that this workshop is pretty neat. Thanks to everybody who contributed to it! I&#x27;ll split my notes into two posts, as Rustlings contain many (many!) exercises. Besides that, I need to learn about the more advanced themes such as threading. In those two posts, I&#x27;ll only describe the exciting bits. If you&#x27;re interested, you can find the solutions themselves on GitHub. I&#x27;d urge you to try by yourself, though.</span>

                    <span>Introduction
MySQL is an RDBMS platform that stores data in a tabular format in a normalized manner, whereas, MongoDB is a NoSQL database that stores information in a schema-less manner as documents that are grouped under collections. The representation of data is completely different and hence migration of MySQL table data to MongoDB collections might sound like a mammoth task. Fortunately, Python makes it a breeze with its strong connectivity and data handling capabilities.
In this article, I will walk you through the steps required to migrate your MySQL table data to MongoDB collections using a simple Python script. The scripts were developed using Python 3.9.5 on Windows. However, it should work with any Python 3+ version on any platform.</span>

                    <span>Is there a difference between incident response and incident management? Virtually every SRE will tell you there is.
However, the exact nature of the differences depends on whom you ask. There are several takes out there on the meanings of incident management and incident response. If you’re an SRE, understanding the surprising amount of variation surrounding definitions of each term can be helpful for thinking about how different types of organizations approach incident response and incident management.</span>

                    <span>As corporations and governments modernize their data architecture — to close this gap between information and outcomes — they are presented with numerous choices now — using a combination of data warehouses, data lakes, and their cloud counterparts.
The evolution of data warehouses in the last decade has changed the way enterprise evaluates technology. Earlier, the evaluation criteria used to be price/performance metric. However, with the explosion of unstructured and semi-structured data, a single solution (data lake or warehouse) cannot handle the big gorilla in the room — that is data variety.</span>

                    <span>It’s difficult to find a boardroom anywhere in the world where cloud-native transformation isn’t a top-five item on the business agenda. Businesses understand that in order to survive and keep up with their competitors, they need to lean heavily into the cloud and embrace it as part of their digital transformation strategy. According to a recent survey of C-suite executives, almost 90% of organizations now understand that cloud technology is going to be a critical step on their path to success. But are they running before they’ve learned to walk? 
Businesses that run headlong into cloud-native transformations tend to do so with an idealized view of what it is they want to achieve. They invest heavily and devote their most valuable resources to trying to achieve the perfect transformation, pinning all of their future successes on it. However, we all know that true perfection is unobtainable, and in pursuing it so doggedly we often cut corners and miss opportunities along the way. The ‘rush to cloud’ has only been exacerbated by the pandemic, pushing companies to up their investments and accelerate their plans for cloud transformation. But rather than speeding up, some of these businesses might be better off slowing down to figure out where they&#x27;re going and how to get there.</span>

                    <span>Service mesh and serverless deployment models represent the next phase in the evolution of microservice architectures. Service mesh enables developers to focus on business feature development rather than managing non-functional microservices capabilities such as monitoring, tracing, fault tolerance, and service discovery.
Open source service mesh projects, including Istio, LinkerD, and Kuma, use a sidecar, a dedicated infrastructure layer built right into an app, to implement service mesh functionalities. So, developers can improve monitoring and trace of cloud-native microservices on a distributed networking system using Jaeger to build an Istio service mesh.</span>

Have you ever imagined why some companies thrive in the competitive economy while others fade away? The answer is straightforward: these companies have gained a stronghold over their customer experience that has resulted in great sales and revenue through the strategic use of software development. They have accounts of happy and contented customers who keep coming for upgrades or application modernization with custom needs.
Throughout this blog, we will look at how customer experience is driving software development and application delivery.</span>

The retrospective is one of the four core ceremonies in scrum methodology. It helps scrum teams to understand what went well, what didn’t, and how to make the next sprint better in terms of people’s relationships, processes set, and tools used.
It’s such an integral part of scrum methodology that the 14th Annual State of Agile Report found that the retrospective is the second most practiced agile technique among agile executives, practitioners, and consultants.</span>

The summit was held “to discuss the nature of &#x27;event-Driven&#x27; applications.&quot; According to Fowler, the &quot;biggest outcome of the summit was recognizing that when people talk about ‘events,&#x27; they actually mean some quite different things.&quot;

                    <span>Every database includes tables, and constraints can&#x27;t be referred to as a rational database system. When any database has only relational data model, it can&#x27;t be a Relational Database System (RDBMS). So, some rules specify a database to function as appropriate RDBMS.  
These principles were developed by Dr. Edgar F. Codd (E.F. Codd) at 1985, who has vast research knowledge on the Relational Model of Database Systems. Codd presents his 13 principles to get a database to test the idea of DBMS contrary to his inaugural model, and when a database follows the principle, it&#x27;s referred to as a true relational database (RDBMS).</span>

                    <span>Web tables, or &quot;data tables,&quot; are a common sight in many web-based applications. These tables are predominantly used for displaying information in a tabular format. Rows and columns are the key identifiers of web tables in Selenium. If you’re using tables in Selenium PHP, you can perform several operations on the table, like fetching data from a specific row-column combination, searching for a particular key string in the table, etc. Selenium web automation should be used for automating the operations on the web tables.
A simple yet effective use of web tables can be seen in e-commerce websites where detailed product information is displayed in a tabular format since it offers better readability. The information in the table can either be static or dynamically populated through some scripts.</span>

                    <span>I think it is a fair statement to convey that software engineers in 2021 are not only working hard but working smart. Building upon lessons learned over the last five years, applications and services are now created as dynamic as possible and are designed to meet laser-focused business needs.
This same approach has found its way into the DevOps spectrum, where what I often refer to as “* as code” allows components to be created declaratively. The approach leverages the same git version control system that feature developers have been using for over 15 years for their source code. DevOps engineers have also made tremendous strides at delivering continuous integration (CI) pipelines that provide packaged software that is ready for delivery.</span>

                    <span>I&#x27;ve been furious for the larger parts of a decade - Partially due to how our governments and the industrialised war machine of the &quot;United Slaves of America&quot; has treated Assange, Snowden and Manning, arguably spearheaded by Silicon Valley - But also due to the fact of that the internet I grew up with no longer exists. However, I am ready, bring on the storm!
In the 90s when I started hanging out in USENET forums, the internet was a machine for good. Its atmosphere was a feeling of that everything was possible, and together we could create better democratic tools, resulting in a better world, by simply coming together, and together do our part. If everybody pulled a little bit more than their own weight, we could all enter &quot;paradise on Earth&quot;.</span>

                    <span>An Overview of Disaggregated Storage
Infrastructure disaggregation allows organizations to use computing resources more effectively by enabling scalability and flexibility. Disaggregation involves decoupling data center resources of memory, compute and storage, so that each resource can be scaled and provisioned independently. Disaggregation is already widely adopted in cloud computing platforms, with various clouds offering storage systems that are completely independent of compute instances.
Disaggregated storage is a version of composable disaggregated infrastructure that offers scalable storage by connecting various physical storage devices over a network fabric to form a logical storage pool, in some cases on demand. Disaggregated storage enables the creation of dynamic environments where the compute and storage resources scale elastically based on the application’s workload. Separating storage and compute instances also means that storage can be scaled and managed without interfering with the availability of an application’s services.</span>

JMS or Java Messaging service is a solution for asynchronous communication using messages (objects). Initially, it was part of JSR (specification used in Java EE).
Simple Problem as Example to Explain: User Creation Service
Let&#x27;s assume we have any service that can process only 100 requests per second. Any higher load will freeze service or put it down.</span>

                    <span>As companies collect more and more data about their customers, an increased amount of duplicate information starts appearing in the data as well, causing a lot of confusion among internal teams. Since it would be impossible to manually go through all of the data and delete the duplicates, companies have come up with machine learning solutions that perform such work for them. Today we would like to take a look at some interesting uses of machine learning to catch duplicates in all kinds of environments. Before we dive right in, let’s take a look at how machine learning systems work.
How Do Machine Learning Systems Identify Duplicates?
When a person looks at an image or two strings of data it would be fairly easy for them to determine whether or not the images or strings are duplicates. However, how would you train a machine to spot such duplicates? Perhaps a good starting point would be to identify all of the similarities, but then you would need to explain exactly what &#x27;similar&#x27; means. Are there gradations to similarities? In order to overcome such challenges, researchers use string metrics to train machine learning models.</span>

                    <span>I’ve worked on websites for several years, both professionally and for side projects. One day, I reflected on the fact that all of my web development education had come from actually making websites. In most cases, I’d have a specific problem, Google how to solve it and learn something new in the process.
I wondered what I was missing by never learning HTML in a comprehensive way. Forget CSS and JavaScript. I’m just talking about raw HTML. It might seem silly to go back to such a basic aspect of web development after a decent amount of experience, but it’s easy to become overconfident with a skill just because you know enough to do a few useful things.</span>

This blog discusses the importance of hybrid multicloud to accelerate business transformation. 
The discussion assumes that the readers are well versed with cloud technology concepts as well as the business value and challenges related to modernizing applications using cloud technologies.
This blog focuses only on the concept of multicloud, which adds new dimensions of complexity and value as opposed to leveraging a single cloud provider.
Evolution of Hybrid Multicloud
The evolution of cloud computing started with the utility computing concept. It began from the concept of dedicated resources vs. shared resource platforms. Businesses have embraced cloud platforms including private, public, hybrid, and hybrid multicloud.
In a simple term, a hybrid multicloud is the use of hybrid cloud and multicloud models as depicted in diagram 1.</span>

                    <span>API Observability is a key component to properly execute APIOps Cycles and ensure your building something of value for your API users. If you’re not familiar with APIOps Cycles, take a look at this guide which provides an agile framework to quickly build APIs that are business-oriented and serve customer needs. API Observability itself is an evolution of traditional monitoring and born out of control systems theory.
Traditional monitoring focuses on tracking known unknowns. This means you already know what to measure like Request Per Second or Errors Per Second. While the metric value may be unknown beforehand, you already know what to measure or probe such as a counter to track requests into buckets. This makes it possible to report on the health of a system (like Red, Yellow, Green), but is a bad tool for troubleshooting engineering or business issues which usually require asking arbitrary questions.</span>

                    <span>Intro
Recently I had to integrate with Google Maps API for a job-related task. I had a great experience working with Google Maps API both on the backend and frontend, but it was not without problems and a lot of research. In fact, I did learn a lot and for this very reason, I decided to share some of the most interesting pitfalls that I fell in.
To show you what I learned I assembled a small no-brainer application. It is a Spring Boot/Thymeleaf web application with the mission to display on a map the employees from an organization. It can display a particular employee on the map, all the employees on the map, and during the creation of an employee, it allows picking an address from a pinpoint on a map. The features that I decided to implement are for the sake of tutorial purposes and they may not make a lot of sense sometimes. The app can be found here: employee-locator</span>

                    <span>Backward compatibility 
Backward compatibility is a property of a system, product, or technology that allows for integration with an older legacy system or with an input designed for such a system. Modifying a system in a way that does not allow backward compatibility is called “Breaking Change.” While in the current era of agile software development demands fast-paced implementation of features to cater to rapidly changing requirements, it is extremely necessary to have backward compatibility in the software being developed.
This article depicts with an example how Java has achieved backward compatibility while developing new features, which will serve as a potential reference while updating existing code.
Let us understand the very important concept of &#x27;widening&#x27; and how it is retained while developing new features like &#x27;Autoboxing&#x27; in Java 5
Widening
In a class that has overloaded methods, one of the compiler&#x27;s jobs is to determine which method to use whenever it finds an invocation for the overloaded method.</span>

                    <span>In most companies the single largest cost is human resources. However, by leveraging Open Source intelligently, you can significantly reduce this cost, by literally having the entirety of GitHub&#x27;s user base, working for &quot;free&quot; for your company. This of course is a bit like what investors refers to as &quot;China math&quot;, but GitHub has 65 million registered user accounts, most of whom we must assume are developers one way or another. If you intelligently structure your organisation around GitHub, there is literally nothing preventing you from using every single one of these developers as your own company&#x27;s resource, making you a million times more productive than mega corporations such as Amazon, Facebook, and Microsoft - For a millionth of the cost these mega corporations are paying. But first let&#x27;s illustrate the problem, such that the solution becomes clear ...
The problem
In one of my previous jobs somebody had cloned an open source git repository, then added its code to our own private corporate cloud&#x27;s git repositories, for then to start modifying the thing (the horror!) 2 years later it took one of my developers 6 weeks to update the thing to use the latest version as created by its main developer on GitHub, trying to keep as many of our own customisations as possible in the process. Needless to say, but I was furious about the original decision, due to having responsibilities for code quality at this company.</span>

I recently found Wicked Coolkit – a nifty retro-themed toolkit – and I thought it would be fun to play around with it to briefly relive those years. The toolkit includes a hit counter, webrings, and developer trading cards.</span>

But things get even more interesting when you start looking at how our various APIs can work together to enable more powerful workflows. In this blog post, I’m going to demonstrate a simple example of that using Adobe Document Generation and PDF Services API together.
Our Demo Scenario
Every month, our company needs to send out invoices. Each invoice goes to a unique company and consists of a series of line items and a total. As these invoices sometimes include sensitive information, we want to protect the document with a unique password so that only the recipient can open it. Altogether this sounds like a somewhat complex process, but let&#x27;s break it down step by step.</span>

                    <span>In most organizations, developers are not allowed to access the production environment for stability, security, or regulatory reasons. This is a quite good practice (enforced by many frameworks like COBIT or ITIL) to restrict access to production but a major drawback is a mental distance created between developers and the real world. Likewise, the monitoring is usually only managed by operators and very little feedback is provided to developers except when they have to fix application bugs (ASAP, of course). As a matter of fact, most developers have very little idea of what a real production environment looks like and, more important, of the non-functional requirements allowing to write production-proof code.
Involving developers into resolving production issues is a good thing for two main reasons:</span>

It is increasingly being used for new purposes, including device security since it can detect and stop threats. Although artificial intelligence is used for cybersecurity threat detection and mitigation, it also poses a risk as hackers utilize it as well.
This trend is rapidly gaining momentum and is part of the reason ransomware attacks increased 150% last year. DevOps developers working on new cybersecurity algorithms must learn to reverse engineer the applications hackers develop with AI to create more robust defenses. Malware has become very sophisticated due to advances in artificial intelligence, making it more complex for users and companies to detect or prevent.</span>

                    <span>There’s no one-size-fits-all approach regarding application monitoring, especially for companies using applications in various cloud environments. Companies are rapidly investing in microservices, mobile apps, data science programs, data ops, etc. Subsequently, they’re also integrating monitoring tools to improve domain-centric monitoring abilities.
AIOps tools help streamline the use of monitoring applications. It allows companies that need high application services to efficiently manage the complexities of IT workflows and monitoring tools. AIOps extends machine learning and automation abilities to IT operations. These robust technologies aim to detect vulnerabilities and issues to resolve them, determine operational trends, and simplify the remediation of the problems that affect their applications’ performance and availability.</span>

                    <span>Introduction
A QR code (abbreviated from Quick Response code) is a type of matrix barcode (or two-dimensional barcode).
HarmonyOS provides code generation to return the byte stream of a quick response (QR) code image based on a given string and QR code image size. The caller can use the QR code byte stream to generate a QR code image.</span>

Data management agility takes precedence among organizations with diverse, distributed, and disruptive environment. It is one of the most crucial deciding factors in determining a company’s potential to transform data into opportunities. But managing data remains an uphill climb thanks to advancements in big data and the Internet of Things (IoT). 
Data management is susceptible to errors and delays that can impact operational efficiency and value generation. Problems aggravate when traditional data management practices are used—and the overall performance of a company hits the skids.</span>

If, like me, you have some difficulties in making a Pass/Fail call for your performance tests when given the Summary Statistics of the performance test results, then the Apdex metric may come in handy.
The Application Performance Index defines a score to report the quality of the user experience across any application. The score ranges from 0.0 to 1.0 and the user experience is split into different ratings as per the following table:</span>

                    <span>In this post, you will learn how easy it is to create a virtual machine with AWS EC2. You will learn the basics and as an example, you will deploy and run a basic Spring Boot application. Enjoy!
1. Introduction
Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) is one of the most popular AWS services. It allows you to create cloud computing instances in no time. You have the choice out of predefined templates (AMI) for several Operating Systems. Pricing is dependent on what kind of purpose the instance needs to serve. Whether you want to have an instance continuously running, or only at a scheduled interval, or you need bare metal, or a dedicated instance, etc. Many options are available for different purposes. Besides that, a lot of different configurations are available to choose from. You will need to choose the right one for your application. In the Free Tier, you only use the micro instance. All of this information is available at the Amazon website and therefore only links to these pages are provided. The offerings may change and you should refer to the Amazon website for the details.</span>

With billions of people using online and digital technologies worldwide, there are ample opportunities for hackers to break the security wall and create unrest all around. Cybersecurity news has become too frequent these days. We see bitcoin mining, credit card credential stealing, injecting malicious code into the systems, stealing confidential data, etc. In today&#x27;s digital world, it is not just about having speed, reaching your customers quickly, easy setup, mind-blowing features, etc., but rather, it is about how safe or secure your systems, data, or features are.
What is Cybersecurity?
The approach and practice of securing electronic data, networks, computer systems, and any form of digital infrastructure from malicious attacks is known as Cybersecurity. Banks, educational institutions, tech companies, government agencies, publishing media houses, hospitals, and every sector invest in cybersecurity infrastructure to protect their customer data, secrets, and business intelligence from attackers.</span>

                    <span>Preface
Designing a MySQL database schema is an inevitable part of the career of every MySQL database administrator or even a developer. Developers and MySQL database administrators usually turn to the schema design side of MySQL to improve query performance, normalize their databases, add or drop certain indexes, modify columns, also for other things.
Generally, what one database administrator considers to be a &quot;good&quot; database design might not seem so perfect for another DBA. Everyone has their own set of preferences—depending on experience and other things—but in general, even while MySQL does move forward at a rapid pace, with improvements being made left and right, MySQL schema design practices do not change much.</span>

For example, a pizza order is useless when its maximum wait time is passed. The customer might have considered ordering from another shop. Also, in a highly dynamic environment like stock trading, a BUY order must be processed within seconds. If not, the order will be irrelevant as the prices can fluctuate.</span>

                    <span>If you watch much TV or read much fiction, you are likely familiar with some typical character archetypes. First, there is the kid who does everything by the book and does well in school. Second, is the character that builds a business by testing the limits and getting the job done while still coloring in the lines. Third, the wild child character throws all of the pieces of a problem in the air to see how and where they will land.
When it comes to project management, there are three main types, just like the characters mentioned earlier. Waterfall is the cautious and rule-abiding kid. Agile is the businessman testing the speed limits to get a product out quickly. Finally, cowboy is the rule-breaker who just wants to get the job done without overthinking the rules they may be breaking.</span>

Let&#x27;s say you&#x27;re a Perl developer distraught at the continued decline in usage and mindshare of your favorite language.
You know that you do good work and that your tools and techniques are sound, but the world outside of Perl-specific forums, software archives, social media groups, and regards it as antiquated, out-of-date, or worse, that IT epithet legacy.

                    <span>In our previous blog posts (1, 2), we explored how query optimizers may consider different equivalent plans to find the best execution path. But what does it mean for the plan to be the &quot;best&quot; in the first place? In this blog post, we will discuss what a plan cost is and how it can be used to drive optimizer decisions.
Example
Consider the following query:</span>

                    <span>What makes a good function or method? It&#x27;s not just one thing, but rather a combination of things where each is significant. If something is flawed, it affects the whole function. So what are these common slip-ups, and how can you avoid them?
It Has a Meaningful Name
Functions should have names that describes their purpose or functionality. When a function has a meaningful name, it&#x27;s easy to read and understand its purpose.
For example, if a function&#x27;s purpose is to find a customer by ID, a good name could be findCustomerById(id: String). It could also just as well be findCustomer(id: String) because the function signature implies that the customer is found by their ID. The word find also implies that the customer might be found or it might not be found.
If the function&#x27;s name would be changed to getCustomer(id: String), its meaning changes because now it implies that there&#x27;s no fallback; the customer is either found or the function fails miserably and maybe throws an exception.
Both are valid names for a function but they have a different meaning and therefore their implementations should also be different.</span>

                    <span>JPA is the standard that guides the developer towards an object conceptualization of his application and provides him with an abstraction of the relational model. However, once the model is in place, several frameworks are available to generate the request or the command. Which choices are the most relevant? Let&#x27;s explore.
Criteria JPA2
Once your dependencies are added, the Criteria API is immediately available. It is the most basic and requires knowing the API and its subtleties to produce requests. The use of these objects obliges to pass directly in character string the name of the attributes in order to impose restrictions. Errors are therefore quite frequent during development and during refactoring operations. Plus, because these errors happen at run time, they are often caught too late.</span>

                    <span>In recent times, cloud computing has evolved as a crucial solution, providing businesses a potentially cost-efficient model for easing their computing requirements and accomplishing their business objectives. However, there are few threats like security that continue to challenge this evolving technology. Here’s a sneak peek into the common challenges faced by cloud customers.
Reliability
Reliability is one of the most common challenges faced by cloud customers, and it all comes down to choosing a cloud provider that is proven and established. Customers need to understand the Service Level Agreement (SLA) as few providers assure a 100% rate of network uptime and refund customers for any downtime.</span>

Of course, most of us create our images by writing Dockerfiles and building them with the Docker engine. And yet, more and more teams are adopting newer alternatives. After all, the Docker image format has been standardized as part of the OCI (Open Container Initiative) a long while ago.</span>

                    <span>The rising popularity of serverless development alongside the increased adoption of multi- and hybrid-cloud architectures has created a lot of competition among platforms. This gives developers many choices about where they can run functions on serverless platforms—from public managed services to on-premises Kubernetes.
If you&#x27;ve read my previous articles about Java serverless, you learned how to get started developing Java serverless functions with Quarkus and how those serverless functions can be optimized to run on Kubernetes. So what should you do next to make your serverless functions fit better with the many choices available to you?</span>

But what use are applications without the data that users interact with? Persistent data is such an indispensable piece of the IT puzzle that it’s perhaps the reason the other pieces even exist. 
Enter cloud and internet scale requirements, essentially mandating that back-end services must be independently scalable / modular subsystems to succeed. Traditionally, this requirement has been difficult in the extreme for stateful systems. No doubt, database as-a-service (DBaaS) has made provisioning, operations, and security easier. But as anyone who has tried to run databases on Kubernetes will tell you: auto scaling databases, especially ones that are easy for developers to use, remain out of reach for mere mortals.</span>

A graph is made up of nodes, sometimes called vertices, and edges. The nodes of a graph typically represent a person, place, or thing and are drawn using a circle. Edges represent relationships between nodes and are drawn as a line between the two nodes.&quot;,&quot;tablet&quot;:&quot;&quot;}},&quot;slug&quot;:&quot;et_pb_text&quot;}&quot; data-et-multi-view-load-tablet-hidden&#x3D;&quot;true&quot;&gt;

However, when transforming from a traditional monolithic architecture to microservices, the common bottleneck is performance. According to Perforce Developer (Perforce Survey) Survey:</span>

This requires an in-depth knowledge of indexing and, also, experience in Postgresql. But, in PostgreSQL, we can get an automatic recommendation of indexes for specific queries by using three extensions hypog, pg_stat_statements, and pg_qualstats. 
Now, let’s move directly to the practical part of how we can use this feature in Postgres.</span>

                    <span>SOA vs Microservices
Should you happen to be researching &quot;Service-Oriented Architecture&quot; (SOA) on the Internet today, the latest articles you are likely to find will typically be titled: &quot;SOA vs microservices&quot;. Complicating the battle somewhat is that you will also find respected industry experts, such as Martin Fowler, stating that some “consider microservices to be one form of SOA, perhaps service orientation done right”.
Martin goes on to declare: “The problem…is that SOA means too many different things and that most of the time we come across something called &#x27;SOA&#x27; [there is]…a focus on ESBs (Enterprise Service Buses) used to integrate monolithic applications. This common manifestation of SOA has led some microservice advocates to reject the SOA label entirely”. As such, for the remainder of this article, I will assume the use of ESB middleware as a fundamental characteristic of SOA landscapes, as well as representing the most fundamental distinction there is between SOA and REST.</span>

                    <span>On one hand, we have a wire-led machine made up of circuits and algorithms. On the other hand exists a human being led by complex emotions and hormones that are triggered by chemical reactions in the brain. These two don’t seem like a match, do they? However, when it comes to creating a hybrid of the two, the two seemingly contradictory concepts — psychology and artificial intelligence — complement each other perfectly.
Artificial Intelligence
Artificial Intelligence, or AI, refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think like humans and mimic their actions. The term is also applied to any machine that demonstrates traits associated with a natural human mind such as learning, critical thinking, and problem-solving.</span>

Motivation
This scenario came out of a real-world situation where I got paged in the early hours of the day by a contractor evaluating our product on behalf of a customer. The contractor was in panic and concerned that she&#x27;d just lost four days worth of work by executing an older version of her application which included a hardcoded TRUNCATE statement. There was no backup available either. We were faced with a situation where we were going to miss customer timeline and lose the precious time reloading the data. We are talking about a multi-TB dataset. Once I had some coffee and we huddled to disucss next steps, we agreed the best next option is to leverage CockroachDB capability where dropped data does not leave the filesystem until garbage collection is complete, which by default is set to 25hours and luckily for us, that property was not changed in the cluster. Needless to say, we were able to recover the lost data following the procedure below.</span>

                    <span>With a long list of end-to-end (e2e) test frameworks available to choose from, it’s hard to know which one you should be using. Cypress and Selenium are leading the market as the most widely used options, but there’s also Appium for mobile app testing, Puppeteer for automating tasks in Chrome, and Protractor for Angular and AngularJS applications, just to name a few.
Recently a newcomer has joined the pack: TestProject, a free, open-source test automation platform for e2e testing that helps simplify web, mobile, and API testing. The TestProject SDK has language support for Java, C#, Python, and, most recently, JavaScript.</span>

                    <span>This year the Red Hat Summit event is a bit different as we bridge the gap from pandemic reality to hopefully a form of normalcy.
As the Red Hat Summit site explains to us, this &quot;...event is expanding to become an all-new, flexible conference series, consisting of a 2‑part immersive virtual experience as well as a global tour of small-scale, in-person* events. This series will create collective opportunities to share experiences, innovations, and insights.&quot;</span>

                    <span>In most cases, you aren’t the only person working on the same project or codebase. That means that other people get to read your code and have to understand it. That’s also true for the code comments you leave behind. Developers often write ‘quick and dirty’ comments without much context, leaving other developers clueless about what you’re trying to say. It’s a bad practice that creates only more confusion than clarifies things.
So, yes - you should be bothered with writing meaningful code comments to help other developers. A code comment that describes the function, the reasoning behind the function, and its input and output will speed up the learning process of other developers. Especially for junior developers, this information comes in handy when learning the code.</span>

In this part, we&#x27;re going to take the architecture we cooked up in the last part, and see if we can&#x27;t get it running in containers, using nothing but Docker itself.

Today, we&#x27;re going to build a radio station. We drew up the architecture in our last post:

They might be discussing it in the context of improving velocity, code churn, code refactoring, or it might just be an item on a very long to-do list that never gets prioritised. We put out a call out for real-world experiences of what helps when it comes to reducing technical debt and received a huge number of responses from devs across a variety of sectors. In the previous article, developers told us about their technical debt horror stories. Here’s what they had to say about how to manage and prevent it:
1. Treat Technological Debt as a Tool Rather Than a Scourge
“Technical debt, like financial debt, is more likely to become an issue if you ignore it or act as if it doesn&#x27;t exist. Instead, accept it and regard it as a method that needs constant attention and maintenance.</span>

For example, says Devadas, insurance companies use hyperautomation to process numerous documents to settle claims. Because of hyperautomation, he says, artificial intelligence (AI)-powered tools can read and extract data at super-human speed from documents, chat, and other channels.  Which allows claims to be processed faster and more accurately than ever before.</span>

                    <span>In-sprint automation is a serious affair, an ambitious goal! It always surprises me how organizations and teams just start on it without proper readiness and planning. And then they fail! Miserably and the team, QA engineers, or some such entity is to blame. Frustrating to say the least. In-sprint automation is doable but not always possible in all teams. If not planned and executed correctly this goal can quickly become a distant dream.
As the name suggests, in-sprint automation is automating and developing the user story in the same sprint. Easier said than done. The team will need to overcome several challenges before getting to this state.</span>

Terraform’s adoption since its mid-2014 release to the software development landscape has been meteoric. More than 8000 organizations are using Terraform for infrastructure automation.
To successfully use the IAC tool, it’s important to optimize HashiCorp Configuration Language (HCL). HCL has become one of the most popular languages on GitHub. Typically though, it’s preferable to work with a familiar programming language rather than learning a new one. The good news here is that the Terraform community, in collaboration with AWS Cloud Development Kit (CDK), recently announced the support of TypeScript and Python for provisioning infrastructure using Terraform. Developers can leverage these languages to optimize the IaC’s tools for many providers and modules.</span>

                    <span>If you have a public-facing web application, the odds are you should probably be thinking about load testing. Any tester can (and should) add load testing to their repertoire.
Functional tests are often carried out with a single user’s experience of your application in mind, but what happens when hundreds or thousands of users are on your site at the same time? Load testing helps prepare an application for this eventuality by simulating that situation before the application goes live. That way, you have time to fix any issues you find, and there are no nasty surprises in production.</span>

                    <span>Query optimization is an expensive process that needs to explore multiple alternative ways to execute the query. The query optimization problem is NP-hard, and the number of possible plans grows exponentially with the query’s complexity. For example, a typical TPC-H query may have up to several thousand possible join orders, 2–3 algorithms per join, a couple of access methods per table, some filter/aggregate pushdown alternatives, etc. Combined, this could quickly explode the search space to millions of alternative plans.
This blog post will discuss memoization — an important technique that allows cost-based optimizers to consider billions of alternative plans in a reasonable time.</span>

                    <span>Finding the right custom software development company that delivers is a complex challenge. It is like hiring a crew to build your new house. Triple check with whom you will work with over the next few months or years as it has a direct impact on your success or failure. As we know at the heart of every successful organization is a quality custom software solution, therefore we decided to create a guide with key factors on how to choose a custom software development company that delivers.
Key Factors to Take Into Account When Choosing a Custom Software Development Company That Delivers
1. Review Portfolios
Explore the prospective software development company’s previous projects. Picking a company with a proven experience in a specific industry, technology, or type of project can be advantageous as they are familiar with the challenges that can occur during a custom software development life cycle for a specific product or feature. When reviewing portfolios, also consider the size of your project. You’ll notice if any custom software development company prefers working with certain-sized projects.</span>

                    <span>Our new mantra for managing and maintaining the health and functionality of our apps and environments is observability. Observability is the quality of software, services, platforms, or products that allows us to understand how systems are behaving. Without the new sources of data giving us insights, our modern cloud-native applications would be quite a challenge to monitor. Observability, that deep data, is the new fuel for our developer and DevOps engineers.
The duality of observability is controllability. Observability is the ability to infer the internal state of a &#x27;machine&#x27; from externally exposed signals. Controllability is the ability to control input to direct the internal state to the desired outcome. While driving, observing a red stoplight means controlling our vehicle by pressing the breaks (or in some modern vehicles, having the brakes applied automatically for us).</span>

                    <span>Following the lingering promise of managed infrastructure, reduced operational cost, and resiliency, cloud computing has seen phenomenal trends in adoption since the past decade. As software development marches towards the cloud, we soon realize that this shift warrants the need to rethink our debugging strategies. This is because as software systems are now leveraging these advancements in cloud computing and distributed systems we see gaps emerging in debugging that cannot be satisfied by the traditional methods of logging and breakpoints.
For example, a major issue while using breakpoints is that the codebase needs to be run in debug mode. Therefore, we are not actually replicating the actual state of our systems taking into consideration multi-threading, distributed services, and dependencies on remote services in a cloud-native environment along with multi-service architecture. Similarly, logs offer no respite, as they may be cumbersome and even costly to execute and store.</span>

But first watch the video.
Linguistic definition
Did you notice how easy it was for me to show you and talk about the core concepts of the chat module&#x27;s backend in the video? That is because as an integrated part of my development and design phase I declared a language. This is what is called a bounded context in DDD. By declaring what words and phrases implies from within the context of my chat module&#x27;s backend, communicating about what it does becomes easier. Below you can see my definitions.</span>

Data science is currently being used to uncover insights that claims representatives claim wouldn&#x27;t be available otherwise, and which can be extremely valuable.

I was recently playing around with Spring Data Elasticsearch (the Spring Data project for Elasticsearch) and came across several issues. One of these was a lack of up-to-date articles. This led me to share my experience using the latest Elasticsearch 7 and Spring Data Elasticsearch 4.1. I hope that my advice can help others gain insight into the tool and how to effectively use it for a variety of reasons.
In this Article, You Will Learn
What Elasticsearch and Spring Data Elasticsearch are.
Basic Elasticsearch cluster setup via Docker (including management and monitoring tool).
How to configure Spring Data Elasticsearch in a project.
How to use Spring Data Elasticsearch to upload and access Elasticsearch data.
What are some pitfalls related to Elasticsearch usage?
First, I will briefly explain the purpose of Elasticsearch.</span>

                    <span>Hackathon competitions might be one of the most efficient methods to motivate developers to create their own solutions. Meanwhile, now not many developers are not familiar with such events and how to prepare for them. In this article, I&#x27;ll explain what tools can simplify your development process as well as increase your chance to win.
What&#x27;s A Hackathon?
The idea of a hackathon is to deliver an application that has to solve one of the problems in a given field within 24/48h. Often competition organizers notify participants about the hackathon subject. So in most of the cases process has the next steps:</span>

Efficient indexing,
SELECT and SELECT DISTINCT statement refinement,
Strategic use of wildcards and conditionals, and
Query cost analysis using EXPLAIN
Introduction to SQL Query and Data Management
Standard Query Language, or SQL for short, allows users access to databases using specific commands or queries, allowing them to change and maintain them. Commands such as SELECT — which helps users extract the data from the database — UPDATE, DELETE, INSERT INTO, and many more, make data management easier for database administrators.
Each of these commands has its own set of functionalities that are useful when working with databases. A few SQL IDEs, such as Arctype, offer developers the ideal framework for visualizing, designing, modeling, and managing their databases. Arctype is a free, collaborative, and intuitive SQL editor to simplify all your data management and visualization requirements.</span>

                    <span>The late 2000s saw a new type of database emerge to address a rapidly increasing number of opportunities and problems related to storing vast amounts of data.
 
 
These non-relational databases were grouped under the term NoSQL and offer flexible schemas, better scaling, and fast queries ACID but do not support transactions.</span>

                    <span>Why Monitor PostgreSQL Database Health?
Just like monitoring our applications, it is very much necessary to monitor our database system. We want to monitor things substantially more granular than system-level processes — things such as:
How many queries actually make use of the index?
How effective is the database cache?
The number of open connections.
And so on.</span>

I highly recommend that you also read a post from my colleague Fernando from a few months ago about the CKAD exam, which goes into much more detail about the aspects of these exams and helps you to pass them. I got some essential tips from reading his post!
Previous Experiences with Kubernetes
In all honesty, exactly a year ago I knew nothing about Kubernetes - it wasn&#x27;t because I had never worked with it, but that I wasn&#x27;t even clear about the concept of &quot;container&quot;. It&#x27;s true that this last year I&#x27;ve been working with this tool frequently (which undoubtedly helped me when preparing for the exam), but I think you need no more than a little previous experience.</span>

                    <span>Aside from holding the publish-subscribe messaging system functionality, Apache Kafka is gaining outstanding momentum as a distributed event streaming platform. It is being leveraged for high-performance data pipelines, streaming analytics, data integration, etc. Additionally, standing as a backbone for IoT data platform to handle massive amounts of heterogeneous data ingestion.
Despite surfacing tremendous usefulness related to data transportation, numerous Kafka connectors for import/export of data from various data systems, still, Kafka client library is an obstacle for any programming language other than Java to serve as producer/consumer of messages to Kafka topic.</span>

                    <span>We have all heard about the pessimist who gives up easily and the optimist who perseveres in the face of failures. When faced with adversity, most people feel indecisive, restless, and anxious about the future.
It is what happens afterward that makes a difference — an optimist is briefly disturbed by the experience but soon bounces back while a pessimist continues to be paralyzed by fear of failure. Optimist storms out of this phase to believe that it’s only a rough patch, while the pessimist spirals into hopelessness with the belief in the permanent nature of their situation.</span>

                    <span>Every programmer comes across Multithreading and for some reason, it has been considered hard to understand. Well, it&#x27;s not. In this blog, we will go through some basics of multithreading and in the process will try to understand why it is such an important topic in software development.
A program can have multiple processes and Multithreading allows us to run these multiple processing units concurrently. Our programs by default run on a Single thread also known as the main thread. Multithreading is useful because:</span>

                    <span>Real-time beats slow data in most use cases across industries. The rise of event-driven architectures and data in motion powered by Apache Kafka enables enterprises to build real-time infrastructure and applications. This blog post explores why the Kafka API became the de facto standard API for event streaming like Amazon S3 for object storage, and the tradeoffs of these standards and corresponding frameworks, products, and cloud services.
Event-Driven Architecture: This Time It&#x27;s Not A Fad
The Forrester article &quot;Event-Driven Architecture: This Time It’s Not A Fad&quot; from April 2021 explained why enterprises are not just talking about event-driven real-time applications, but finally building them. Here are some arguments:</span>

                    <span>Package management is one of the things Go has always missed. One of the major drawbacks of the previous (pre 1.11) go get was lack of support for managing dependency versions and enabling reproducible builds. The community has developed package managers and tools like Glide, dep, and many others serving as de-facto solutions for versioning dependencies.

                    <span>Before OOP languages, the programmer would control how the program is executed and that would be from the app’s main routine. In modern programming, that control is delegated to the external non-main loops, and the main routine becomes an event-loop that waits for events to occur and then executes it with the relevant event handler.
This new model of programming (it has been around since the 70s though) is called event-driven programming.</span>

                    <span>In our technology-driven world, electronic communication is increasingly overshadowing verbal communication. Whether we are filling out an online form, sending a text on our phone, or writing an email, it is a fact that many of our business and personal interactions require efficiently written (typed) language. Due to this heavy reliance on electronic communication, it is critical to ensure your online platform has a support system built-in to account for human error; if your application or website allows input or search queries from users, you run the risk of your systems not understanding the text due to spelling errors — and this is where spellcheck comes in.
When you stop and consider how many times you encounter spellcheck in your electronic interactions, it should become clear that it has created a huge failsafe for our often rushed and impatient natures. Spellcheck has come a long way since its beginnings; the first spellcheckers simply verified words instead of suggesting corrections. Fast forward to our current era and spellcheckers have improved in both functionality and efficiency; they operate in the background of our applications and let us know with a red line that we have made a potential error. This is often accomplished with Natural Language Processing (NLP) which, as we have discussed previously, enables computers to process and interpret human language in the form of text or audio data.</span>

                    <span>Motivation
CockroachDB is a cloud-native SQL database for building global, scalable cloud services that survive disasters. It makes building geo-distributed databases easy. Ability to anchor data to geographic localities is a unique capability of CockroachDB. Today, I will demonstrate this ability to extend beyond regions, availability zones, nodes, data centers and racks. The architecture allows us to domicile data to specific storage devices using storage attributes.
High-Level Steps
Start a CockroachDB cluster with multiple disks per node using storage attributes
Create a table pinned to a specific disk type
Create another table and verify its location on disk
Evict the second table to demonstrate granularity
Assign proper storage constraints deterministically
Verify Setup

                    <span>A web filtering appliance is an internet content filter that obstructs web-borne threats such as malware, ransomware, and phishing from impacting a database. It also allows network administrators control over what online content can be viewed by network users. Therefore, as well as keeping networks and the devices that link to them safe from viruses, a web filtering appliance can also help enhance productivity in the workplace.
Every time a network user visits a link or enters a URL into a browser bar, the web filtering appliance compares the request to open a web page against blacklists of websites and IP addresses. The blacklists are kept up to date with details of websites and IP addresses known to store malware or linked with spam emails, spam emails being a high-risk vector for phishing attacks.</span>

Although there is no shortage of reports on overall software testing trends, the state of testing at the organizational level—particularly at “household name” brands—has historically been a black box. On the one hand, large organizations often have access to resources far beyond the reach of smaller businesses (for example, commercial as well as open-source software, access to consultants and services, etc.). But on the other hand, they face daunting challenges such as:</span>

                    <span>Introduction
Technology is ever-evolving, and we have seen a major shift in application platforms from on-premise to cloud and containerization, application architecture from monolithic to micro-service, and many more. Organizations today are working towards making the operations an easy task and reducing the cost, as it is one of the painful areas where the project spends a lot of time and effort to streamline the entire process. Jenkins X is one of the platforms which has such kind of capability.
For an individual who is into technology, the familiarity of the name Jenkins is not uncommon. But &quot;What is Jenkins X?&quot; and once we will know about it, certainly, there will be more questions in our mind, and most of them will be answered in this essential document.</span>

                    <span>Every time I travel to Japan, something that strikes me is how process-driven the Japanese people and culture seem to be. Even something as simple as buying a train ticket is an intricately refined process. The ticket seller first makes sure they have heard and understood you correctly, repeating back your exact request before they print the tickets. And once they’re printed out, they will pick up a pen and check each detail of the ticket — before going through each check again with you. You will be given exact and clear instructions on how to locate the platform and when to expect the train. And you’ll notice that when the train arrives and stops at the platform, the driver also has a checklist they will diligently follow. It’s incredible to observe, but not arbitrary — they do this because they have found it reduces error rates by up to 85% and ensures everything runs smoothly.
You might be wondering what Japan has to do with successfully coaching teams, particularly within an Agile framework. And the answer is Shu Ha Ri. This Japanese concept, roughly translated to “first learn, then detach, and finally, transcend” (or more simply: walk, run, fly) is a way of thinking about the stages of learning from beginner to master — and a key philosophy used in the martial art Aikido. Working in an Agile way requires much learning of new rituals, processes, and different ways of thinking, so if you are a scrum master, this concept can be a very useful one for understanding and guiding you in how to be a better team coach and ensuring that each project runs just as smoothly (and to time) as a bullet train.</span>

                    <span>Frontend developers want to build awesome experiences. Yet they need data from the backends and perform actions against backends. The answer to their problem is APIs. Who builds those APIs? Are they built quickly or are the frontend developers left waiting? Who runs and manages the APIs? After all, the backends do not behave in uniform ways — they speak different languages, emit differently shaped data, have varying authentication requirements, and so on. So running and managing the frontend APIs is not a task to be taken lightly.
Here are some considerations as you think through the APIs that are the gearbox between the frontend and backends.</span>

Are you having problems realizing the speed and agility promised by continuous delivery (CD)? Does continually delivering new code seem impossible to you? Feature flags might be the tool you&#x27;re missing. Without them, implementing CD is difficult. With feature flags, it&#x27;s not just easier; it&#x27;s better.</span>

                    <span>Nic Raboy remembers the challenge of database management from his experience at a previous employer that ultimately led him to a career as Senior Developer Advocate at MongoDB. &quot;Every time we had to scale, which was about once a year, we had to throw more money at servers to make them more powerful. Not only that, but you had to actually shut down the database to scale it up. We&#x27;d have to worry about backups and making sure that things don&#x27;t go south during the process.&quot;
MongoDB helps solve many of the pain points of database management by delivering a distributed database platform built for the cloud era. Millions of developers around the world use MongoDB to power companies with massive troves of data to manage, such as Google, SAP, eBay, Sega and EA.</span>

                    <span>End-to-end (E2E) tests are often neglected, due in large part to the effort required to implement them. In many cases, E2E tests are performed by hand, which can be a tedious and error-prone task. Automation solves many of these problems by ensuring a consistent, production-like test coverage of the system. In this Refcard, learn the fundamentals of E2E test automation through test coverage, integration, and no-code options.</span>

                    <span>Introduction
We’ve all been there when we have to manually redline our designs so developers know exactly what our perfect designs are actually showing; we have even tried sending over source files for our devs to use when implementing. But isn’t there a better way of sending over detailed design information? 
There are ways we can make markups easier and a way of disseminating this information quicker and more efficiently. This is of the utmost importance; if a developer doesn’t have all the information in front of them they will not spend precious time digging around for important information, a good handoff is a detailed project with information to hand or directly on top of the designs for quick implementation.</span>

                    <span>End-to-end (E2E) tests are often neglected, due in large part to the effort required to implement them. In many cases, E2E tests are performed by hand, which can be a tedious and error-prone task. Automation solves many of these problems by ensuring a consistent, production-like test coverage of the system. In this Refcard, learn the fundamentals of E2E test automation through test coverage, integration, and no-code options.</span>

                    <span>As awesome as flexbox is, what it’s doing under the hood is actually a little strange because, by default, it is doing two things at once. It first looks at the content size which is what we would get if by declaring width: max-content on an element.

                    <span>What is SAML 2.0?
At its core, Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) 2.0 is a means to exchange authorization and authentication information between services. SAML is frequently used to implement internal corporate single sign-on (SSO) solutions where the user logs into a service that acts as the single source of identity which then grants access to a subset of other internal services.
The advantage of adopting SAML/SSO from a security perspective is clear:</span>

                    <span>A faster startup and smaller memory footprint always matter in Kubernetes due to the expense of running thousands of application pods and the cost savings of doing it with fewer worker nodes and other resources. Memory is more important than throughput on containerized microservices on Kubernetes because:
It&#x27;s more expensive due to permanence (unlike CPU cycles)
Microservices multiply the overhead cost
One monolith application becomes N microservices (e.g., 20 microservices ≈ 20GB)
This significantly impacts serverless function development and the Java deployment model. This is because many enterprise developers chose alternatives such as Go, Python, and Nodejs to overcome the performance bottleneck—until now, thanks to Quarkus, a new Kubernetes-native Java stack. This article explains how to optimize Java performance to run serverless functions on Kubernetes using Quarkus.</span>

                    <span>Project Context
This year a number of financial services firms have had to comply with a new &quot;401(k)-to-IRA Rollover Advice&quot; fiduciary rule. This rule mandates that wealth managers and broker-dealers must demonstrate &quot;investor&#x27;s best interest&quot; intent when presenting investment opportunities to their clients.
Many financial services firms with legacy and 3rd party SaaS application landscape face a common challenge of data lineage and data consistency throughout the client onboarding user journey. Throughout this journey, the client’s investment profile is used to put together a proposed investment portfolio and open an investment account.</span>

                    <span>In every project performance testing, assessment, and resolution become the key phase before going to production. In this article, there will be a sneak preview of key concepts, lifecycle steps, tips, and further guidance.
I will try to cover the holistic view in this short writing including non-functional requirements with high-level details but the focus will be on the performance aspect mainly, beyond this a lot more detailed steps will be involved. Additionally, the focus will be on Java-based web applications mainly while some of the details are generic and applicable to other platforms and technologies.</span>

                    <span>In the B4X developing suite, B4J is used to develop desktop apps based on JavaFX or server apps based on Jetty. By default, it cannot be used to create web applications without a server. A third-party library, BANano, makes this possible. It can transpile everything you write in B4J to Javascript, HTML, and CSS. The project can run purely in the browser.
Dynamsoft Barcode Reader is written in C++. It provides a JavaScript version that uses WebAssembly. The barcode decoding can be done on the client-side which is a good match for BANano.</span>

JetStream allows you to persist streams of messages, allows consumers to either subscribe in real-time or to access the messages at a later time with the added flexibility to choose from wherein the stream you want to start receiving messages. You can start reading from the stream at a specific point in time or start at a specific message sequence number.</span>

                    <span>What users want in your app? What makes a user download one app and pass on another? What keeps them coming back, and why did a rival app get more installs last month? All these and more questions are what devs face every day in their work trying to create products that serve users.
Here at Setapp, we are facing these exact questions (we offer users 210+ apps in a single subscription). This is why this year, for the first time ever, we conveyed a survey of user preferences in Mac apps. In this first-of-its-kind survey, we asked users about their preferences and app choices. I’d like to share these findings to help devs have a better understanding of user preferences and needs.</span>

Of course, you can write a web app-based UI or a single-page application, but sometimes, especially in the IoT world, and a small cluster of Raspberry Pis, the easiest way is to have actually a small Desktop UI.</span>

I’m not sure how many posts will be in the series, but, well, at least two? If you missed Part I, you might want to catch up on it before continuing.
This part of the project was the first hardware build of the project. I have now built and deployed a complete outdoor weather station to gather data about current weather conditions outside the greenhouse. This will allow me to compare conditions inside the greenhouse with conditions outside the greenhouse, and compensate accordingly.</span>

                    <span>Any web service needs to export their public API if consumers want to make the best use of that service. A developer-friendly approach to do so if you work in the Java ecosystem is to package DTOs and endpoint interfaces in an API jar file and use the Retrofit framework to create type-safe clients for integration testing. This article discusses a complete example.
If you’ve worked in enterprise Java projects you will remember good old Web Services Description Language, the XML based format for describing network services by IBM and Microsoft. Maybe you still work with it? WSDL and its twin XML Schema are among those W3C standards that seasoned developers love to hate. Its specification files are not very human readable, let alone human writable. Fortunately you don&#x27;t have to. They can be generated by your server endpoint and fed straight into a code generator to create transfer objects (DTOs) and service stubs.</span>

What is Power Automate
Power Automate is one of the products of the Microsoft Power Platform family. It is a web-based service that helps you create automated workflows between your favorite apps and services to synchronize files, get notifications, collect data, and more. Power Automate is available as part of the Office 365 suite and is available in most Office 365 subscriptions.</span>

                    <span>PGBouncer is a lightweight connection pooler for PostgreSQL. CockroachDB is a cloud-native SQL database for building global, scalable cloud services that survive disasters.
CockroachDB is a PostgreSQL wire compatible database, which means it aims to have tight compatibility with the PG ecosystem. Today, we&#x27;re going to wire PGBouncer to work with CockroachDB. This article is meant to scratch the surface of possibilities unblocked by PGBouncer with CockroachDB and not meant to be an in-depth overview. We&#x27;re currently researching this topic and will follow up with official docs on the proper architecture and sizing of PGBouncer and CockroachDB.</span>

                    <span>It&#x27;s safe to say that every modern web application these days relies to some degree on three foundational web standards: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. While HTML has largely stabilized since the HTML5 standard, both CSS and JavaScript continue to evolve to meet developers&#x27; and users&#x27; needs.
The evolving nature of these three technologies has lead to the introduction of web components, a cross-browser solution for building complex web apps. On top of this open source standard, Salesforce developed Lightning Web Components (LWC) as a fast, enterprise-grade wrapper around vanilla web components. The result is a thin, performant, and feature-packed framework built entirely on the open web.</span>

                    <span>Introduction
I left Microsoft after 19 years, where I led teams that built system software for highly scalable cloud applications. This included leading development of the Microsoft Orleans framework from its inception at Microsoft Research until it became one of the most successful open-source projects within the .NET ecosystem. Orleans powers a number of large-scale Microsoft systems such as Xbox Game Services, Skype, Azure IoT, Azure ML, Azure Active Directory, and many more cloud services outside Microsoft. So if you’ve ever played online multiplayer games like Halo or Call of Duty, our team built much of the underlying infrastructure that supports it.
When I originally joined Orleans, cloud computing was still in its infancy. We had a 10,000-foot vision and not a single line of actual code. We needed to reimagine how cloud-scale applications should be coded because, at the time, available and high-performance scalable systems were only achievable by experts. And while everyone knew the cloud was coming, we had no idea how to build applications in a way that ensured they would be accessible and productive for millions of software engineers.</span>

                    <span>Assuming you&#x27;re working in an environment where you have to communicate and collaborate with others, avoiding micro management starts out with the architecture of whatever you want to build. I was once asked how I would go ahead of leading a software development department, and my answer was; &quot;Well, first of all, I consider everybody to be a lead developer one way or another.&quot;
The above is a crucial mindset to facilitate for autonomy.

                    <span>In this post, I’m going to show you how to set up and run your very own private, dedicated Minecraft server in the cloud. I have blogged about this before, but the server was limited to 1 CPU core and 1 GB of RAM in that post. In this post, we&#x27;re going to create a server with up to 4 CPU cores and 24 GB of RAM! That’s more than enough resources to host a game with 20+ friends with excellent performance (and still have enough leftover to create another server for something else). And best of all, it’s absolutely free! Forever!! I’m sure you’re just as excited as I am about this, so let’s jump right into it and get started!
Why Is This a Big Deal? 
In this post, we’re going to launch a new OCI Virtual Machine that uses a new Ampere Arm chip. These VMs provide better price-performance and near-linear scaling for CPU-bound workloads compared to x86-based instances. They are suitable for a wide range of workloads including web applications, media encoding, AI Inferencing, and much more. We’re very proud that Oracle is now partnering with leading technology vendors to make Arm server-side development first-class and easy.</span>

                    <span>User feedback is vital to the success of our projects. It can help us identify which new ideas we should pursue as we develop and can keep us focused on delivering just what users need.
Minimum Viable Feedback (MVF)
We have all seen projects that didn’t have the right user validation and feedback. We know this information is important, but getting it, and using it effectively, can be difficult. This can be especially problematic with new projects where you can get into that tricky phase of being slightly ahead of where the users are. It may be tempting to wait to proceed based on user feedback, but that leads to a “chicken or egg” scenario. The faster you can provide meaningful improvements, the greater the adoption, which means greater feedback.</span>

While declarative infrastructure, programmatic deployments, and repeatable automation are desirable, they aren’t capable of resolving or preventing incidents in every major infrastructure. Even using Kubernetes to restart containers can only solve a certain class of issues. There are still problems for operator teams tasked to hold things together until the next version reaches production.</span>

                    <span>Introduction
In the previous post of this series &quot;AWS Application Deployment Basics,&quot; we set up a PostgreSQL database and then we connect to it via a NodeJS application.
However, the Nodejs application is running on the same machine and database access is local for it. It is a totally valid setup and because it is on the same machine, the access is straightforward. But, having applications and databases running on separate machines is also a very common setup and we will cover that path as well later in this series. But today, we will focus mostly on the web server we want to run on an EC2 instance in the public subnet.</span>

                    <span>There are some qualities that differentiate average from high performing software development companies and attitude towards the software architecture culture is one of them.
Software Architecture Culture
The culture is better and the results are much better in teams where software developers and architects pay particular attention to software architecture quality. In teams where it’s all about delivering tickets as quickly as possible, the culture and results are poorer. It is proven! However, it is very important to highlight that where there is too much focus on software architecture and not enough on delivery is hugely counter-productive as well. Both valuing software architecture and striving for continuous delivery are critical.</span>

                    <span>How the Security Industry Fell a Decade Behind the Broader Tech Industry
I’m not going to sugarcoat it; the security industry has fallen way behind the broader tech industry in the last decade in a really fundamental way. While much of the tech industry has started to pivot away from hardware and software-based solutions – which dominated the 90s and early 2000s – and towards the use of API-first SaaS services, most of the security industry has not.
Now, this reluctance to embrace a new way of delivering security outcomes means that customers are overburdened with acquiring, deploying, and managing security tools in a legacy model. A painful, not to mention expensive, way to defend against threats.</span>

As organizations begin their Lean and Agile journey with SAFe®, SPCs will introduce a tool designed to help organizations determine the best, most logical place to launch their first Agile Release Train (ART). The Value Stream and ART Identification Workshop is designed to help organizations identify the sweet spot where an opportunity to deliver value intersects with a clear problem to solve, leadership support, a clear product or solution, and collaborating teams.
It’s challenging to meet the criteria mentioned above, which is why many are tempted to launch ARTs within easier-to-identify constructs such as organizational silos. This rarely works. As we know, value often does not follow the organizational hierarchy. However, it’s important to understand that value stream identification is the first step in an ongoing practice of flow management to optimize the speed of delivery, quality, and customer delight.</span>

                    <span>For a long time software development processes have been using packages. A package, for all intents and purposes, is a container file. Much like a zip file, they contain other files such as binaries, source code, scripts, and also a manifest that tells users what this project package means. Some common usages of packages are to make it easier to reuse and share code or to deploy code dependencies to different projects. Often, having a formal system with packages can help expose bugs sooner, making it easier to deliver trustworthy software. FlexDeploy packages, along with other built-in continuous integration and delivery functionality, will allow for a significant increase in productivity for developers and release managers.
In this blog, we will explore the significance of partial projects, how we can utilize project packages, and also integrating change management into the build and deployment of those packages.</span>

                    <span>GPUs Continue to Expand Application Use in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning
Artificial intelligence (AI) is set to transform global productivity, working patterns, and lifestyles and create enormous wealth. Research firm Gartner expects the global AI economy to increase from about $1.2 trillion last year to about $3.9 Trillion by 2022, while McKinsey sees it delivering global economic activity of around $13 trillion by 2030. And of course, this transformation is fueled by the powerful Machine Learning (ML) tools and techniques such as Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL), Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN), Gradient-boosted-tree models (GBM), Natural Language Processing (NLP), and more.
Most of the success in modern AI and ML systems is dependent on their ability to process massive amounts of raw data in a parallel fashion using task-optimized hardware. In fact, the modern resurgence of AI started with the 2012 ImageNet competition where deep-learning algorithms demonstrated an eye-popping increment in the image classification accuracy over their non-deep-learning counterparts (algorithms). However, along with clever programming and mathematical modeling, the use of specialized hardware played a significant role in this early success.</span>

All those tutorials do a very good job in helping the developers to get started using gRPC in their projects. We can find materials talking about gRPC server, stub client, interceptors, protobuf, encrypted connection, load balancing but hardly we find all this together and prepared for a real production scenario. Deployments to production are not discussed and available resources are sparse.
There are some projects that provide a collection of handy features that can help you to set up gRPC communication in a reliable way but they are all generic building blocks without an initial structure that you can evolve from.</span>

                    <span>One of the most impactful ways to reduce spend on Kubernetes infrastructure is to make sure your clusters are optimally sized for the workloads they run. Working with many teams over the past year we have seen that it’s not so obvious how to arrive at an optimally-sized cluster, even in autoscaling environments. In response, we are publicly launching a new tool that we’ve used to help teams recently! While implementing this solution with users so far we’ve seen savings in the range of 25-60%, even having a major impact in autoscaling environments.
How It WorksPermalink
This new tool generates context-aware cluster sizing recommendations after analyzing Kubernetes metrics on historical workloads and cloud billing data. As a user, you only need to provide the context of the cluster, i.e. whether it is being used for development, production, or high-availability workloads. We then recommend cluster configurations, which optimize for the respective balance of cost, simplicity, and performance/headroom. Because this solution is Kubernetes native, we consider the following when providing recommendations:</span>

“Doesn’t DevOps use that guy Jenkins to monitor something called technical debt so that we can have a cleaner Git, which somehow allows our Kubernetes to Docker? All I know is that our operations people don’t like it when we release on demand, and our annual software releases just deliver last year’s trends too late.”</span>

                    <span>Does it ever cross your mind that praise can be negative? I guess not. After all, it looks harmless and seems to be quite effective. Conventional wisdom says that if you praise people, they are motivated to do better.


 
People who have been praised throughout their life by their well-meaning parents, friends, and teachers for their talent and smartness or those who have experienced extreme focus on talent and smartness throughout their childhood learn to value only intelligence. No wonder when these people enter the workforce, they continue to seek approval and demand praise every step of the way.

                    <span>Plagiarism is the term given to the borrowing of someone else’s ideas and passing them around as one’s own. It exists in academia, in professional work environments, and any other field where there’s a creation of some kind of content involved.
It’s considered a serious offense, leading to copyright laws, fines, and even imprisonment (in some severe cases). Today, there are software and other special practices implemented to keep plagiarism in check.</span>

Augmented reality is already becoming more commonplace by the day.

In terms of business, cloud access means that AR users can operate seemingly free from hardware while applications enable businesses to link the data-driven power of the computer with human judgment and expertise. 
It’s this collaboration between rich data and human intervention that makes AR an ideal asset in the world of fintech. The sector is growing while augmented reality represents the next logical step in making finance run on brand new tech.</span>

                    <span>Overview
Git Flow is an abstract idea of a Git workflow. It helps with continuous software development and implementing DevOps practices. The Git Flow Workflow defines a strict branching model designed around the project release. This provides a robust framework for managing larger projects.  
Git Flow is ideally suited for projects that have a scheduled release cycle and for the DevOps best practice of continuous delivery. It assigns very specific roles to different branches and defines how and when they should interact. It uses individual branches for preparing, maintaining, and recording releases.</span>

                    <span>The serverless Java journey started out with functions—small snippets of code running on demand. This phase didn&#x27;t last long. Although functions based on virtual machine architecture in the 1.0 phase made this paradigm very popular, as the graphic below shows, there were limits around execution time, protocols, and poor local-development experience.
Developers then realized that they could apply the same serverless traits and benefits to microservices and Linux containers. This launched the 1.5 phase, where some serverless containers completely abstracted Kubernetes, delivering the serverless experience through Knative or another abstraction layer that sits on top of it.</span>

                    <span>Kubernetes is much more than a runtime platform for Docker containers. Through its API not only can you create custom clients, but you can also extend Kubernetes. Those custom Controllers are called Operators and work with application-specific custom resource definitions. Not only can you write those Kubernetes operators in Go, but you can also do this in Java. Within this talk, you will be guided through setting up and your first explorations of the Kubernetes API within a plain Java program. We explore the concepts of resource listeners, programmatic creation of deployments and services, and how this can be used for your custom requirements.</span>

                    <span>When building applications and programs for use by other developers, ensuring you are utilizing valid code identifiers is an important component. These unique identifiers are symbols that have been designated to specific program elements essential to the successful creation of a program, and they can refer to a wide variety of features, including class, namespace, types, variables, and more. To avoid any confusion or misinterpretation, the names given to the symbols should clearly indicate the usage of the corresponding element. The general idea is to create an identity of sorts for the symbol so that it can easily be identified by any individual, not just the original developer.
During the creation of these integral program pieces, it is also important to be conscious of the technical nuances of the applicable programming language; for example, since Java is case sensitive, identifiers that have different cases will be treated differently. As you may know, attempting to navigate the various rules and requirements for code identifiers can take up a lot of time, so we are going to highlight an easy tool you can integrate to do the work for you. The following API can be run in Java to validate input identifiers and analyze for incorrect strokes including usage of whitespace, hyphens, underscores, and other special symbols within the identifier. This is accomplished by configuring input rules for the symbols, such as allowing the identifier “helloWorld” but not &quot;hello*World&quot;.</span>

                    <span>If a low-code development platform wants to implement complex business processes, the following conditions must be met.
1. What Is Automation?
Automation is the key to improving efficiency, reducing human error and reducing operating costs. Repetitive work will require fewer workers, and more employees will focus on strategic decision-making and creative problem solving.

2. The 2 Types of Automation Technology
Robotic Process Automation (RPA)
Business process automation (often referred to as business process management or BPM)
In general, low-code automation capabilities can more prompt companies that rely on repetitive processes to evaluate how to improve efficiency. They will need to retrain and redistribute employees to assume roles that can leverage their experience and institutional knowledge with strategic capabilities.</span>

DZone Dev of the Month - Mir Ali

From DZone Editor Samantha Ross: &quot;Mir Ali (DZone profile) never fails to bring the fire and wisdom to his beautifully worded articles. His focus this May was on Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC), but since he started only this past December, he&#x27;s shared his knowledge on everything from AI to DevOps. Both his published pieces this month I classed as phenomenally well-written, and I&#x27;d like to congratulate Mir on his growing DZone portfolio and engagement, having hit his 100k this month. Looking forward to what&#x27;s next!&quot;</span>

And most of these were questions to which I did not have a good answer.  I couldn’t respond well to them because I didn’t have the data necessary to give a definitive answer.  
The data was there, but without a way to get at it, I often felt like I was stumbling in the dark. But all is not lost.  Here are eight questions that I had, and ways that data inside your tools can be used to answer them.</span>

                    <span>I often help people automate the configuration of their infrastructure so they can build 3-node clusters that span Availability Zones and Regions. The CLI for creating a DataKeeper Job and associated mirrors that contain more than one target can be a little confusing, so I&#x27;m documenting it here in case you find yourself looking for this information. The DataKeeper documentation describes this as a Mirror with Multiple Targets.
The environment in this example looks like this:
PRIMARY (10.0.2.100) - in AZ1
SECONDARY (10.0.3.100) - in AZ2
DR (10.0.1.10) - in a different Region
I want to create a synchronous mirror from PRIMARY to SECONDARY and an asynchronous mirror from PRIMARY to DR. I also have to make sure the DataKeeper Job knows how to create a mirror from SECONDARY to DR in case the SECONDARY or DR server ever become the source of the mirror. EMCMD will be used to create this multiple target mirror.
We need to first create the Job that contains all this possible endpoints and define whether the mirror will be Sync (S) or Async (A) between those endpoints.</span>

                    <span>The following is the first in a series of posts related to feature flags across CI/CD.
 
Continuous integration (CI) and feature flags look like a match made in heaven. Integrating code regularly, combined with the ability to isolate new features and turn them on and off at will, means you can move fast and still manage risk.
But with great power comes great responsibility. Feature flags require careful planning and continuous management, just like your builds do.</span>

                    <span>For quite a while now, developers have used snippets of code to turn features on and off during runtime. These code snippets, more commonly known as feature flags, allow you to change features (or sub-sections) of your application without re-deploying. They help developers release code faster, with less risk. 
Feature flags are more prevalent than you might believe. At most companies, though, adoption begins at the grassroots level. Developers—usually within a single team, and often just a few individuals—implement a handful of feature flags in an ad hoc way. In these early stages, feature flags aren’t usually being considered at a systemic level. They’re meant to solve specific pain points at specific points in time. There is no formal program in place, and there are no plans to manage flags across teams.</span>

                    <span>Route53 is an AWS service that provides a mapping between domain names and IP addresses. At first glance, this could lead us to think that we can&#x27;t do an effective hands-on with Route53 without having to purchase a domain name from AWS or any other domain registrar. We should fear not, for AWS provides an option for a private hosted-zone to create and test the Route53 concepts.

                    <span>Event-Driven Architecture: Bust or Fact?
Alright, let&#x27;s face it—there is a lot of content talking about how REST vs messaging APIs and how one is more fir than the other for a microservices architecture design. I wrote a blog post about My journey to learning EDA that highlights what event-driven architecture is. Whether you are new to event-driven architecture (EDA) or have some background with it via dabbling with gRPC, kafka, rabbitMQ, Solace, or whatever messaging API, I am here to share with you 5 claims about EDA that I will be busting or confirming. 
 
 
I Will Have to Re-Design My Rest-Heavy Architecture From Scratch To Adopt EDA
 

MYTH
Advanced event brokers allow for protocol translation within the broker. What does this mean you might ask? Well, it is very common in any software architecture design approach to have a polyglot of protocols and APIs in an application. Whether you are using REST, or different messaging protocols (MQTT, AMQP, Solace, Kafka...etc) you would want your different microservices to communicate with each other.</span>

                    <span>In the reading of Natural Language Processing (NLP) applications, we inevitably encounter two main features in action, Categorization and Extraction, and learn how those can be manipulated in so many different ways to effectively address use cases that involve free-form text and the retrieval of information from it. We also hear a lot about Sentiment (which technically is not a separate feature but rather a specialization of the previous two). Finally, we have POS-tagging, which is only occasionally mentioned outside of deeply technical articles for linguists and NLP professionals. 
We don’t hear much about other NLP capabilities, and this is mainly because often, depending on how an NLP engine is designed, features beyond Categorization and Extraction are not present at all. Specifically, many NLP solutions today are based on Machine Learning algorithms, and ML rarely delivers great accuracy in problems that require both elevated precision and super-fine identification. Then again, some of these capabilities are incredibly useful, in fact sometimes even the only way to address a particular challenge. In the following, I make the case for one of these not-so-popular NLP tools: SAO (Subject-Action-Object).</span>

                    <span>As an engineer, to succeed in product development, you have to change your perspective and move from valuing technology or the product to focusing on the business model. As an entrepreneur or a product manager, you have to understand that you are not developing a product but a business model. A product manager must continually ask themselves the question: What is the minimum experiment I should do next to minimize uncertainty (or learn) the most?
 
 
Using the question as a guide will help you get the evidence that the people need the product and there is sufficient market for it. You don&#x27;t require a large budget, scalable architecture, and a large team before validating the product-market fit.</span>

I’ll teach you how and why authentication systems hash passwords. Along the way you&#x27;ll learn about salting and key derivation functions. I&#x27;ll also demonstrate how to apply these concepts using a Django application server.
Every authentication system has to store some representation of your password. You must reproduce your password in response to a username and password challenge when you authenticate. The system compares your reproduced password with the stored representation of it as a means of authenticating you.</span>

There are plenty of failure possibilities with Scrum. Given that Scrum is a framework with a reasonable yet short “manual,” this effect should not surprise anyone. Neglecting the critical Scrum artifact for continuous value creation is one of the common Scrum anti-patterns. If your Scrum Team strives to make your customers’ lives easier Sprint after Sprint, beware of the oversized Product Backlog.

This is not new because, time and time again, it has proven to be one of the best investments that a company makes in its history of financial decisions.
Take Slack for example. You might have heard about it, as it is probably one of the best team communication applications out there. It started as a simple communication tool for a group of game developers that wanted to communicate together.</span>

In this tutorial, I will explain different CI/CD concepts and tools provided by AWS for continuous integration and continuous delivery. I will be creating a Spring Boot microservice and deploy it to AWS EC2 instances running behind an application load balancer in an automated way using the AWS Code Pipeline. In this tutorial, you will have hands-on experience in developing a spring boot microservice and how it can be deployed in the cloud. You will learn about CI/CD and its benefits. What is AWS Code Commit, what is AWS Code build and AWS Code Deploy and their benefits. You will also learn about the AWS Code pipeline and how it can help you to orchestrate your software release process. This is part 1 of 2 videos:</span>

I wish they&#x27;d just leave Perl static.

                    <span>1. Introduction
As Agile Coaches, many of us need to gauge the Maturity of our teams, and one of the tools which we all use is an agile Maturity assessment. However many of us tend to over-engineer it or tend to complicate the way our questions are framed and the way we analyze the responses.  In this article, I present a very simple yet effective way to get a quick dipstick check on where the Transformation is progressing.
2. Proposed Agile Maturity Assessment Model
As Agile professionals, we all are aware of the 4 Values and 12 Principles enshrined in the &quot;Manifesto for Agile Software Development.&quot;</span>

The article is roughly divided into four parts:
The first part will briefly introduce some real project data, including time-consuming data before and after optimization so that friends can understand how much optimization space is there for integration testing, and highlight why integration testing needs to be optimized.
The second part will introduce the composition of integration test execution time through some examples so that everyone knows where the time is spent.
In the third part, I will remove the &quot;cloud&quot; of the Spring test framework source code, and take the friends to briefly understand the principles of Spring integration testing.
Finally, I will give some useful suggestions for optimizing the execution time of Spring integration tests.
Integration Testing
Here are a few words. We have been pursuing automated testing for a long time. The fundamental reason is that automated testing is more reliable and cheaper than humans. Integration testing is an integral part of automated testing.</span>

                    <span>In some use cases, it is necessary to provide deep links in an Angular application. Without support for multiple languages, it is simply the URL + the angular route. With Angular i18n the different directories for the language build need to be supported. This article shows how to support language-independent deep linking. The AngularAndSpring project will serve as an example. It is a Spring Boot application that provides the backend with the rest endpoints and serves the Angular frontend in the &#x27;resources/static/&#x27; directory. 
Frontend
The frontend contains these file and directories:</span>

We appreciate this effort and the great results of open-source technology. In that article, Rick used the popular Star Schema Benchmark (SSB). 
We know this benchmark very well. One of Altinity founders and Percona CTO Vadim Tkachenko uses it quite regularly when comparing different open source analytical options (in 2017 and in 2020). A few weeks ago another real-time analytics company Rockset published their results claiming much better performance and efficiency compared to Druid. We decided to take a closer look at the Druid and Rockset approach, and see how ClickHouse can perform.</span>

As of now, it consists of approx. 500 lines of code and 20 methods with a public access level (including hashCode, equals, toString, and Javadocs) with various possibilities. 
Today, I will show you what this API evolution looks like through the subsequent Java releases and what were the reasons for its introduction to Java. I hope that it will give you some more knowledge about Optional class itself, help to convince your coworkers to start using it instead of a simple null check or even to decide which Java version to use in your company or private project.</span>

                    <span>Introduction
In 2021, applications are now the entryways most businesses use to connect to customers, and while this accelerated with the pandemic, it began long ago and will continue into the future. Seamless performance for these applications can mean the difference between gaining a loyal customer or losing trust. The threat of developer burnout, and application issues, are both very real and there are a few key practices that organizations can implement to support developers and set their teams up for success. 
Recognize Pressure Is Real and It’s Not Slowing Down
With the growing reliance on digital and cloud-native applications, developers and technologists are feeling the pressure. That’s naturally going to come back on the business.</span>

Here is the list of 5 things or decisions you should consider before starting a wireframe. These are the crucial questions that should be asked at the early stage of your project and it’ll smoothen your wireframing process.
1. Device Support
Usually, the stakeholders will tell you which devices to support, but sometimes you will realize that it will be cross-platform or responsive by studying the goals of the product. Or, you might have to select the best devices for the product.</span>

Varnish is a caching server, and a great one at that, that much we already know. But what about the content you don&#x27;t want to cache? For example, those shopping cart requests and other completely uncacheable API calls?
We can, of course, handle it, but we&#x27;ve got to be wary of the sirens of the cargo cult because you will often see something like this on the internet:</span>

Unauthorized access to protected data can potentially cost millions of dollars in the form of various financial penalties. Almost every application needs some reliable tool to manage its users’ identities and accesses. 
There are a bunch of solutions on the market — both free and paid — that promise to provide such features. In today’s article, I will try to present you one of these tools, which as you probably guess from the title, will be Keycloak.</span>

With IoT technology moving as fast as it is, there is a lot of new technology to keep up with. It can be difficult to stay informed on the latest tech to facilitate a potential solution. In this article, we will break down four established asset tracking technologies to better understand their ideal use case in asset tracking. 
As is often the case, some of the newest options are the most expensive and feature-rich. Meanwhile, other options have dropped in cost due to large-scale adoption. A new generation of Bluetooth Low Energy, (BLE), Radio Frequency Identification (RFID), Long Range (LoRa), and Ultra-Wide Band (UWB) have brought new possibilities to industries hoping to solve the problem of, where did that thing go?</span>

                    <span>Java developers are usually required to take many actions before we can begin developing and deploying cloud-native microservices on Kubernetes. First, we have to configure everything from the integrated development environment (IDE) to build tools such as Maven or Gradle. We also need to configure the command-line tools used for containerization and generating the Kubernetes manifest. If we don’t want to spin up a Kubernetes cluster locally, we also must connect to a remote Kubernetes cluster for continuous testing and deployment.
Developers should spend less time on configuration and more time accelerating the inner-loop development cycle of building, testing, and deploying our applications. Ideally, we should be able to continuously develop applications in a pre-configured Kubernetes environment.</span>

We are in the Digital Economy and as it applies to all economies in the world, the success of this relatively new but no longer nascent economy will depend on how well the stakeholders of this economy maximize their resources by reusing, replicating, connecting, and interoperating them. The value of synergy is always greater than the value of individual components contributing to it and this force multiplier needs to be capitalized in a massive way by modern-day enterprises if they wish to succeed in the digital economy.
The advertisement moolah that Google and Facebook rake in is precisely because they do not look at their business entities in siloes; rather they connect and integrate valuable customer data points from various entities like; for example, Gmail, Google Maps, and YouTube to generate one unified persona related data impression that becomes the basis for their targeted advertisements and their consequent success rates. Likewise, Netflix integrates and converts data on the subscriber consumption pattern to intelligent movie recommendations that lead to higher viewership, greater new subscriptions, and improved Net Promoter Scores (read word of mouth).</span>

                    <span>Web Sockets and asynchronous message transmissions over socket connections is probably one of the most difficult tasks you can possibly do in any web application. Hence, to make it manageable, it needs to be simplified, the same way the gearbox in your car is simple to use, even though it probably involves thousands of moving parts. In this article I will walk you through how to create a live chat client using SignalR, Web Sockets and Magic. If you wish to follow the tutorial though, the first thing you&#x27;ll have to do is to download Magic.
The Angular frontend
First we&#x27;ll need a frontend. Use the Angular CLI to create a new Angular project and name it &quot;chat&quot;. Open a terminal on your development machine and execute the following command in it.</span>

                    <span>What did you feel while seeing the price tag of a product in a supermarket? You may not realize it, but machines can read these incredibly nuanced subtilities of human expressions, and retailers can use it to their advantage. A device loaded with a specific software program can predict whether a person is smiling out of frustration or joy. Human-computer interaction has gone beyond the realms of sci-fi fantasies and turned into reality. The rise of emotionally aware machines has blurred the human-machine divide, and it is now redefining the way people experience technology.
What Is Affective Computing? 
Emotion AI, also known as Affective Computing, is all about how AI can decode the emotional status of a human being by analyzing their facial expressions, such as head motion, facial distortions, movement of jaws, and speech pattern, etc. It detects, recognizes, and emulates human emotions through a programmed AI neural network. Without a doubt, humans can analyze and interpret complex emotional signals better. However, the gap is narrowing faster than you can imagine, thanks to advancements in big data capability and powerful algorithms.</span>

                    <span>Web based terminal access is one of those crucial components to have if you truly want to build your own DIY cloud system. The first time I came to appreciate web terminals, was with Digital Ocean&#x27;s droplets, which gave me a web based terminal, allowing me to directly modify my server any ways I saw fit through my browser. Golly gosh that was a najs day.
With a web terminal, you&#x27;ve got all of these features &quot;for free.&quot;</span>

                    <span>Kubernetes has dramatically shifted the trade-offs of on-prem versus SaaS deployments. Thanks to the rich abstractions Kubernetes provides, deploying software on-premises can be significantly easier than it used to be. Because Kubernetes has achieved such high market penetration (and still growing), it is now a viable target environment for many software products. Nevertheless, Kubernetes requires external tools to be production ready, especially on an on-prem deployment.
The purpose of this article is to list tools that everyone should be aware of when it’s time to move an on-prem Kubernetes cluster to production, and by on-prem, we mean not in a cloud environment. In the cloud, it is obviously better to rely on cloud services offered by the provider.</span>

Need of Hypothetical Indexes:
As the name suggests, these are not real indexes, these are hypothetical indexes i.e. they are virtual indexes that PostgreSQL query planner does not consider when running queries.</span>

                    <span>Hello there! I&#x27;m a newbie here, but I have a great love for Arduino and smart devices. I have tried a lot of types of devices using the same app (smart life) and tuya cloud. Officials say there are more than 200,000 SKUs; well I think they are quite cheap and widely distributed. However, it is hard to connect Arduino with Tuya cloud.
The Arduino support team answered my question and provided the support and demos. To make a long story short, the steps they gave me might be helpful for you:</span>

Site reliability engineering (SRE) practices help organizations by ensuring the smooth functioning of their deliverables with utmost reliability and resilience. These can be achieved by a set of well-defined tools that are deployed at every phase of the production system to keep up with SRE best practices.
This blog identifies and lists the chain of top SRE tools and their significance towards ensuring the reliability of the architecture.</span>

                    <span>Introduction
Smart parking development implies an IoT-based system that sends data about free and occupied parking places via web/mobile applications. The IoT device, including sensors and microcontrollers, is located in each parking place. The user receives a live update about the availability of all parking places and chooses the best one.
In order to investigate the technologies behind the smart parking solution, we implemented an internal research project. The main idea was the creation of smart parking using the Internet of Things and ultrasonic sensors, where available parking places could be displayed in a web application.</span>

1. Introduction
Even if you do not know what Robot Framework is, it is really worth the effort to continue reading. The DocTest library might save you a lot of testing time, but it requires some knowledge of Robot Framework. In case you do not know what Robot Framework is, read some of the previous posts in order to get a good introduction.</span>

                    <span>What Is Testing Maturity?
The software testing process is an ever-shifting entity. It has to keep changing to accommodate changing requirements, device-browser-OS releases, and numerous other factors that show up with increasing frequency. Inability to change will cause the pipeline to stagnate and roll out software that doesn’t match current performance and design standards.
Testing Maturity designates the extent to which the process is optimized and formalized to accept and incorporate changes. This ranges from ad-hoc practices, formally established stages, result metrics, and optimization efforts on each level. Testing Maturity reveals how well the process is shaped, measured, managed, monitored and the results it yields.</span>

                    <span>As a security best practice, AWS recommends that users with privileged permissions should use MFA for extra security measures. 
As an AWS administrator, it is your job to make sure users enable MFA. In order to auto-enable this feature, the below policy can be applied to users, which will allow them to enable MFA if it is not enabled already. Once MFA is enabled, only then other activities can be resumed.</span>

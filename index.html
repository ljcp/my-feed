                    <span>Why Do We Need a Standalone Runtime Server?
We can deploy our application on Anypoint Studio. The application has an embedded Mule runtime server and we are deploying it on Anypoint Studio. But in production, we won’t do that. We need to start a standalone Mule Runtime.
How to Start a Standalone Runtime Server?
1. We need to download Mule Runtime Server from the link:

A prime number is a natural number that is greater than 1 and divisible by 1 and itself. That means the prime number will have only two factors 1 and that number itself. Some of the prime numbers are 2, 3, 5, 7,11,13, etc.

                    <span>At Ubiq Security we focus on data security and making it easier for developers to incorporate encryption into their applications.  As part of our work, we spend time on Slack, Stack Overflow, Reddit, etc. and we see several common mistakes that can cause security vulnerabilities that are easy to resolve.  While we don’t think any developer wants to make an insecure product, it is easy to understand how developers not experienced in data security might not realize the impact of grabbing some sample code from the Internet and incorporating it into their application.  I often say that writing programs incorporating encryption or data security is not like other software development.  Just because an application runs, doesn’t mean you are done or that your application is secure.
Common Mistake 1: Inadvertently Reducing the Range of A Hashed Value

I first met Icecast (https://icecast.org/) when I worked at a web-hosting startup around the turn of the millennium. One night, one of my co-workers and I had the crazy idea to load a bunch of audio files on the networked file server and stream them to our workstations. We could listen to music while we worked 90+ hours a week. Strange times. After realizing it wasn&#x27;t as simple as exporting .ogg files over HTTP, we found Icecast (and its pal, Ices2) and built a rudimentary, local-network broadcast radio station.</span>

                    <span class="article-reading-time">(4 min)</span>
                    <span>1. Choice of Programming Language
The language depends on the type of cluster. A cluster can comprise of two modes, i.e., Standard and High Concurrency. A High Concurrency cluster supports R, Python, and SQL, whereas a Standard cluster supports Scala, Java, SQL, Python, and R.
Spark is developed in Scala and is the underlying processing engine of Databricks. Scala performs better than Python and SQL. Hence, for the Standard cluster, Scala is the recommended language for developing Spark jobs.
2. ADF for Invoking Databricks Notebooks
Eliminate Hardcoding: In certain scenarios, Databricks requires some configuration information related to other Azure services such as storage account name, database server name, etc. The ADF pipeline uses pipeline variables for storing the configuration details. During the Databricks notebook invocation within the ADF pipeline, the configuration details are transferred from pipeline variables to Databricks widget variables, thereby eliminating hardcoding in the Databricks notebooks.
Notebook Dependencies: It is relatively easier to establish notebook dependencies in ADF than in Databricks itself. In case of failure, debugging a series of notebook invocations in an ADF pipeline is convenient.

Cheap: When a Notebook is invoked through ADF, the Ephemeral job cluster pattern is used for processing the spark job because the lifecycle of the cluster is tied to the job lifecycle. These short-life clusters cost lesser than the clusters which are created using the Databricks UI.
3. Using Widget Variables
The configuration details are made accessible to the Databricks code through the widget variables. The configuration data is transferred from pipeline variable to widget variables when the notebook is invoked in the ADF pipeline. During the development phase, to model the behavior of a notebook run by ADF, widget variables are manually created using the following line of code.</span>

                    <span>It is incredible just how much information we have today stored in PDF format. According to the PDF Association, approximately 2.5 trillion PDFs are created every year, making up 6 percent of the web. As a web developer, though, PDFs aren&#x27;t always the most outstanding experience online:
Viewing experiences vary significantly across different users and devices because they depend on a PDF viewer. Whether it is embedded in web browsers or free online libraries, some viewers are better than others. Adobe Acrobat Reader is generally the universal standard for viewing PDFs properly. Google Chrome is also very common. However, many things have worked in Acrobat that still don&#x27;t work or render correctly in Chrome.
It becomes difficult for me to be able to incorporate PDFs into the rest of my website. Most often, PDFs would prompt users to download PDFs on their devices.
Converting PDFs to HTML is complicated and unreliable. If I want to present content inside a webpage that is in PDF format, I might often flatten it to PDF to make it easier to embed.
I have no visibility into how my visitor is viewing those PDFs. This means that I have no idea if someone is reading certain pages, how long they spend on those pages, etc.
Fortunately, Adobe PDF Embed is an excellent solution to solve all of these challenges.</span>

                    <span>As the New York Times best-selling author, Brené Brown says, “Leadership is not about titles or the corner office. It’s about the willingness to step up, put yourself out there, and lean into courage.” In today’s cultural and work environment, we’re no longer able to avoid sensitive and pressing issues, but many leaders are paralyzed by the fear of making mistakes in the way they address them. This is especially true when it comes to addressing concerns around diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI).
That’s why our host, Federico Toledo, wraps up season three of Quality Sense with an illuminating interview with a leader in the DEI space. Ash Coleman has had a very unique and interesting career path that has led her to her current role as the Head of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion at Credit Karma. Before that, she was a professional chef who made a transition into software testing. These professional experiences have led her to understand what goes into making amazing experiences and products that meet the requirements of a diverse population.</span>

Since TypeScript 3.4, we’ve been able to use the as const notation for creating “const assertions” on our literals. This is used to signal to the compiler that any object properties of the literal are read-only, any array literals are read-only, and lastly that any literal types used cannot be widened.</span>

Unfortunately, the ways businesses often store this data make it challenging to extract the valuable insights hidden within — especially when you need it for smarter data-driven business decision-making.
Standard reporting solutions such as Google Analytics and Mixpanel can help, but there comes a time when your data analysis needs to outgrow capacity. At this point, you might consider building a custom business intelligence (BI) solution, which will have the data integration layer as its foundation.</span>

                    <span>Introduction
Project management isn’t just about managing projects. It is a collaborative effort of stakeholders, ranging from in-house teams to outsourced partners. In all fairness, the latter is a more complicated space since an outsider in a possibly different time zone has to access your data, processes, and teams. While outsourcing digital product development projects, enterprises have a long road to trek. Issues from lack of credibility to unclear objectives are directly responsible for a failed engagement and ultimately a sub-standard quality of end output. 
If your outsourcing partner is not performing as per expectations, the fault may be at your end. Here are the top mistakes that project managers knowingly or unknowingly commit while hiring product development partners.</span>

                    <span>In an enterprise system, populating a data lake relies heavily on interdependent batch processes. Typically these data lakes are updated at a frequency set to a few hours. Today’s business demands high-quality data not in a matter of hours or days but in minutes or seconds.  
The typical steps to update the data lake are (a) build incremental data (b) read the existing data lake files, update incremental changes, and rewrite the data lake files (note: S3 files are immutable).  This also brings in the challenge of ACID compliance between readers and writers of a data lake.</span>

                    <span>When it comes to designing large and complex software systems, microservices architecture is the most common choice nowadays. If you design the microservices architecture in the right way, it certainly becomes a peace of mind. However, if you make some basic mistakes while designing microservices, it becomes a pain of mind in no time. Hence, it is important to not make some basic mistakes in the first place, so as you don&#x27;t have to rectify and fix them at a later stage when your microservice is already in production and being used by a vast number of consumers.
In this article, we will look at one such biggest and most basic mistake you don&#x27;t want to make with your microservices.</span>

                    <span>I hate shopping in brick-and-mortar stores. However, my interest in virtual shopping is not limited to the buyer experience only. With the MobiDev DataScience department, I’ve gained experience in working on AI technologies for virtual trials. The goal of this article is to describe how these systems work from the inside.
How Virtual Trial Room Technology Works
A few years ago, the “Try before you buy” strategy was an efficient customer engagement method in outfit stores. Now, this strategy exists in the form of virtual fitting rooms. Fortune Business Insights predicted that the virtual fitting room market size is expected to reach USD 10.00 billion by 2027.</span>

This is article is a follow-up to Data Platform as a Service, describes the high-level architecture, and goes into details on Data Lake. We will detail the rest of the blocks and components shown in the next articles.
The important thing about the architecture is not the vendor or specific product but the capabilities of the components we used. In the end, the product choice depends on many factors:</span>

                    <span>Docker is a popular open-source containerization platform and it frees your hands to build your applications in development and production. In this post, I&#x27;m going to walk you through how to build a production-grade HTTPs secured Nginx server with Docker, Docker Compose, Let’s Encrypt (its client certbot). Let’s Encrypt certificates last 90 days and will need to be renewed after the certificate expires. So I will also provide details to script the renewal in crontab in Docker container.
1. Basic Example
In development, we need a basic Nginx container without HTTPs to fast setup our local test environment. I use Nginx official docker image and wrap up all the stuff with docker-compose.</span>

                    <span>“It is not necessary to change. Survival is not mandatory.” -W. Edwards Deming Work takes time to flow through an organization and ultimately be deployed to production where it captures value. It’s critical to reduce time-to-production. Software - for many organizations and industries - is a competitive advantage. Organizations break their larger software ambitions into smaller, independently deployable, feature -centric batches of work - microservices. In order to reduce the round-trip between stations of work, organizations collapse or consolidate as much of them as possible and automate the rest; developers and operations beget “devops,” cloud-based services and platforms automate operations work and break down the need for ITIL tickets and change management boards. But velocity, for velocity’s sake, is dangerous. Microservices invite architectural complexity that few are prepared to address. In this talk, we’ll look at how high-performance organizations like Ticketmaster, Alibaba, and Netflix make short work of that complexity with Spring Boot and Spring Cloud. In this workshop we&#x27;ll look at how to build cloud-native Java systems that are elastic, agile, observable and robust.</span>

                    <span>For many companies, getting products out the door faster is one of the main reasons to adopt DevOps. But speeding up software delivery is only one aspect of why companies should embrace an agile CI/CD approach. There are other things to take into consideration and, if you are a financial institution, the list can be even bigger.
I recently chatted with Ben Angell and Sanmat Jhanjhari of Nationwide Building Society as part of the virtual DevOps Enterprise Summit Europe. Ben leads the DevOps Engineering team and Sanmat is lead DevOps architect at the UK-based mutual financial institution, which is also the largest building society in the world.</span>

Introduction
This sample project demonstrates a basic setup of a server and a client. The communication between the server and client happens through HTTP, so there is no encryption at all yet. The goal is to ensure that all communication will be encrypted.</span>

                    <span>Identity and access management are critical components of many applications. However, enterprise companies that are using multiple EKS, AKS, or GKE cloud Kubernetes clusters for various projects may find it challenging to identify the right level of access for different users, especially when there are multiple users and groups of users who are coming, going, and moving between teams.  
As teams expand their usage of Kubernetes, clusters and workloads will exist in different environments. One team may be building their stack on cloud provider “A,” while another team is building a stack on cloud provider “B.” Even on a single public cloud service, clusters may exist in different environments, and IT isn’t even aware of these things. This makes tracking all of the individual logins and permissions across the organization next to impossible, especially when there are multiple accounts and access levels to manage. And the problem only grows in complexity as more people on-board, off-board, or change teams, and projects multiply.</span>

                    <span>If global companies manage their data efficiently, they would never have to lock horns with deploying data science strategies. It does sound simple until you know that ‘efficiently’ is an ocean of complexities and beyond the expertise of most businesses. Capturing and orchestrating data is a rough path but a necessity to undo data silos and provide immediate results to on-demand search queries. And that is why we need data orchestration that is purposefully meant to enable quick access and yet protect it from widespread fragmentation.
How Does Big Data Orchestration Work? 
Orchestration tools are a middleware layer between the data warehouse (source points) and the business applications such as CRM, BI Analytics, etc. Through pre-built connectors and API adapters, these tools perform rapid integration of all source points with the main silos. It simplifies data monitoring from a single point while enabling the teams to perform seamless fetching. All of this is achieved without having to develop custom scripts or devoting additional resources.</span>

                    <span>Introduction
Chances are when you hear &quot;0.77 cents on the dollar,&quot; an increasingly contentious subject — the gender pay gap — comes to mind.  Today, we will explore a US Bureau of Labor Statistics dataset containing information about America&#x27;s workforce (as of Jan. 2015) to answer the following questions:
Which industries are most and least affected?
Is the gender wage gap the same across all industries?
How much does an average American salary vary by gender?
To answer these questions, we&#x27;ll be importing the dataset mentioned above (available on Kaggle) into an Arctype SQLite database, where we&#x27;ll use queries and dashboards to manipulate and interpret the data.</span>

                    <span>Due to the exponential growth of digitalization, the entire globe is creating a minimum of 2.5 quintillion (2500000000000 Million) bytes of data every day and that we can denote as Big Data. Data generation is happening from everywhere starting from social media sites, various sensors, satellites, purchase transactions, Mobile, GPS signals, and much more. With the advancement of technology, there is no sign of the slowing down of data generation, instead, it will grow in a massive volume. All the major organizations, retailers, different vertical companies, and enterprise products have started focusing on leveraging big data technologies to produce actionable insights, business expansion, growth, etc. 
Overview
Lambda Architecture is an excellent design framework for the huge volume of data processing using both streaming as well as batch processing methods.  The streaming processing method stands for analyzing the data on the fly when it is in motion without persisting on storage area whereas the batch processing method is applied when data already in rest, means persisted in storage area like databases, data warehousing systems, etc. Lambda Architecture can be utilized effectively to balance latency, throughput, scaling, and fault-tolerance to achieve comprehensive and accurate views from the batch and real-time stream processing simultaneously.</span>

                    <span>Last week saw the release of Perl 5.34.0 (you can get it here), and with it comes a year&#x27;s worth of new features, performance enhancements, bug fixes, and other improvements. It seems like a good time to highlight some of my favorite changes over the past decade and a half, especially for those with more dated knowledge of Perl. You can always click on the headers below for the full releases&#x27; perldelta pages.
Perl 5.10 (2007)
This was a big release, coming as it did over five years after the previous major 5.8 release. Not that Perl developers were idle—but it wouldn&#x27;t be until version 5.14 that the language would adopt a steady yearly release cadence.</span>

                    <span>Look, we know the software development process is not an easy one to measure and manage, particularly as it becomes more complex and more decentralized. In many companies, there are multiple teams working on smaller parts of a big project-and these teams are spread all over the world. It&#x27;s challenging to tell who is doing what and when, where the blockers are and what kind of waste has delayed the process. Without a reliable set of data points to track across teams, it&#x27;s virtually impossible to see how each piece of the application development process puzzle fits together. DORA metrics can help shed light on how your teams are performing in DevOps.
What Are DORA Metrics?
Well, these metrics didn&#x27;t just come out of thin air. DORA metrics are a result of six years&#x27; worth of surveys conducted by the DORA (DevOps Research and Assessments) team, that, among other data points, specifically measure deployment frequency (DF), mean lead time for changes (MLT), mean time to recover (MTTR) and change failure rate (CFR). These metrics serve as a guide to how well the engineering teams are performing and how successful a company is at DevOps, ranging from &quot;low performers&quot; to &quot;elite performers.&quot; They help answer the question: Are we better at DevOps now than we were a year ago?</span>

If you’re a regular reader of this blog, you might know that I wrote already about Event Sourcing in the past. It’s a complex pattern, probably one of the most complex to get right. I enjoy the challenges it gives and how it causes a whole plethora of other patterns to be evaluated in conjunction (CQRS anyone?).</span>

                    <span>In the U.S. alone, pipeline operators maintain around 3 million miles of natural gas distribution mains and pipelines. They often run through stretches of remote wilderness, across difficult-to-access terrain, or deep underwater. While traditional monitoring tools like SCADA systems can be effective, they also have significant weak points.
American water infrastructure is similar in length, made up of around 2.2 million miles of pipes that can be difficult to monitor due to location. Innovations are helping to provide more effective pipeline monitoring solutions. Internet of Things (IoT) devices could have a major impact on how pipelines are monitored. Why is the IoT the foundation for a new kind of intelligent pipeline monitoring?</span>

                    <span>It’s been a long time waiting but it’s finally here: starting with Apache Kafka 2.7, it&#x27;s now possible to use TLS certificates in PEM format with brokers and Java clients. So, why does it matter?
PEM is a scheme for encoding x509 certificates and private keys as Base64 ASCII strings. This makes it easier to handle your certificates. You can simply provide keys and certificates to the app as string parameters (e.g. through environment variables). This is especially useful if your applications are running in containers, where mounting files to containers makes the deployment pipeline a bit more complex. In this post, I&#x27;ll show you two ways to use PEM certificates in Kafka.</span>

                    <span>Introduction
Kubernetes adoption is on the rise as organizations increasingly get a grasp on what is needed to effectively manage and scale the popular platform.
That’s one of the key takeaways from a recent Traefik Labs survey of 1,097 respondents, the majority of which were software engineers and DevOps professionals. The survey found that the adoption of Kubernetes is at a strong 70%, indicating that the platform is rapidly increasing in adoption. Yet 58% say they run less than half of their business-critical applications on the container-orchestration system, implying room for wider Kubernetes uses throughout most organizations.</span>

                    <span>Container registries serve as libraries to store and access third-party container images required during the build phase of the SDLC and the images produced for deployment to test, staging, and production environments.

                    <span>Background
In my previous post Managing Secrets Deployment in GitOps Workflow I talked about SealedSecrets, which is one of the ways to keep Kubernetes secrets in version control to implement the GitOps workflow. This approach has the following downsides:
The sealed secret is encrypted with its own random asymmetric key that is specific to the sealed secret name and namespace and therefore copy-pasting the encrypted data for another secret or in another namespace won&#x27;t work.
Secondly, by default, SealedSecrets generated for a cluster won&#x27;t work with another cluster because the installation of Bitnami Controller creates a new pair of public/private keys. This makes the overall GitOps implementation approach cumbersome. 
One solution may be to export and import the same set of keys from one cluster to another. However, if the key on a cluster gets compromised, it would grant access to all sealed secrets on all clusters with the same key pair.</span>

                    <span>When you want to erase sensitive data from your hard drive permanently, make sure it is not recoverable in any manner. You can try permanent deletion that includes, erasing or ‘wiping’ data using various overwriting techniques. In this article, we&#x27;ve shared the best effective methods to wipe hard drive data beyond the scope of recovery.
We all keep some personal data on our devices. But, storage devices, like hard drives, have a lifespan after which, they may fail to perform, and you may want to dispose them. You may also want to donate or share your device with your friends or family. Whatever the situation is, you must wipe the hard drive to prevent any unauthorized access.</span>

                    <span>Introduction
The HTTP Custom Caching policy enables you to store HTTP responses from an API implementation or an API proxy for reuse. To optimize against computation-heavy processing, this policy avoids performing multiple calls to the backend when the response of a service does not change often. This policy uses a cache, which enables a faster service for data requests.
In Mule 4, Mulesoft already provides an HTTP cache policy, which is available out of the box with standard configuration and works very well with runtime object-store v2. If an existing out-of-the-box policy is available then why do we need a custom policy?</span>

                    <span>Getting Started with Apache Camel? This post is for you. But I am not going to dive into how to write the Camel route, there are plenty of materials out there that do a better job than me. A good place to get started is the one and only Camel Blog, it gives you all the latest and greatest news from the community. If you want to start from the basics, I highly recommend Camel in Action II Book. It has everything you need to know about writing Camel. Or join the Camel community mailing list or Zulip to ask questions, it&#x27;s very friendly and welcoming.
If you are a returning Camel rider, I would go through this post, where it will get you up to speed on what to expect.  Another good resource is the FAQ page. I found the majority of the getting started enquiries can be found here.</span>

     A business analyst and a developer may have different objectives and perspectives 
     
   Here’s an example of a conversation that you may have been part of sometime in your life as a developer. 

 
 
Business Analyst: Our next user story involves creating an API (let’s call it “Customer API”).
 
 
Developer A: How novel! That’s what I did yesterday and the day before and the day before that.
 
 
Business Analyst: Great, should I let the clients know that it wouldn’t take as long to build it?
 
 
Developer A: Hold on. We haven’t even heard the requirements for Customer API.
 
 
Business Analyst: It’s just a couple of hundred fields that Customer API needs to send to another downstream API to perform the transaction.
 
 
Developer A: And how will we know the values for these fields that Customer API needs to send?
 
 
Business Analyst: I’ll take care of it. I have already spoken to the lead developer from the downstream API team, and he’s sent me a spreadsheet. It has all the fields and the values that need to be part of the request body. He’s also sent me a document with information on the headers and auth details required to call the downstream API.
 
 
Developer A: Is this downstream API available in a testing environment? A playground, maybe?
 
 
Business Analyst: They’re still working on building the downstream API, so they don’t have a working version yet.
 

In Development
Developer A gets to work. She pairs with Developer B, another application developer on her team, to finish the Customer API story. Business Analyst sends them an email with a spreadsheet containing the fields and a document that includes the API currently in development by the downstream API team. It seems like Developer A and Developer B have all the information required to start building the Customer API, so they come up with the following list of tasks:</span>

You are modernizing a Core System and have defined a Target Business Architecture (BA) that will replace it. You are following the defined modernization roadmap and are in charge of the modernization of one of the Business Capabilities of the Target Business Architecture. Now, you need to understand how the current Core System is addressing the Business Capability, i.e., you have to map which legacy system is providing the business capabilities associated with this system in the BA. 
Usually, the core system will be a set of monoliths, applications, services, and transactions that are integrated and tightly coupled so that if you map all of them and its integrations, you will end up with a picture like this one:</span>

                    <span>Looking for a way to jazz up your websites or applications? Creating compelling imagery to accompany your copywriting, service offerings, and projects can be an excellent method for ramping up your content. One type of imagery that has become incredibly popular, especially during the digital age, is the composite image. A composite image is made up of two or more images, which are merged together to create a single composition. The resulting composite image often depicts people or objects in implausible, improbable, or impossible circumstances, such as a 21st-century man in an 18th-century city, or a castle in the clouds. Another slightly more practical application of the technique is to integrate photos of landscapes or backgrounds with lighting or other visual aspects that are generally technically or physically unachievable.
While this technique may sound relatively uncomplicated in our current technology-driven world, it was a different story when the composite image was first created in the mid-1800s. Artists and photographers began toying with the layering effect by literally cutting, gluing, and juxtaposing photos and paintings together to market and memorialize large social events. As society moved into the World War I era, the process utilized the virtual reality effect to create scenes of soldiers with their loved ones, as well as propaganda for the war effort.</span>

By any measure, MongoDB is a popular document-oriented JSON database. In the last dozen years, it has grown from its humble beginnings of a single lock per database to a modern multi-document transaction with snapshot isolation. MongoDB University has trained a large number of developers to develop the MongoDB database.
There are many JSON databases now. While it&#x27;s easy to start with MongoDB to learn NoSQL and flexible JSON schema, many customers choose Couchbase for performance, scale, and SQL. As you progress in your database evaluation and evolution, you should learn about other JSON databases. We&#x27;re working on an online training course for MongoDB experts to learn Couchbase easily. Until we publish that, you&#x27;ll have to read this article. :)</span>

                    <span>First of all, do not let the title deceive you — it will not be simple println(“Hello world”) but with Actor System. Today, we will implement your first (sorry if I assumed wrongly) video streaming service. Namely, I will use Akka HTTP and Streams to create a REST API capable of streaming a video file, in mp4 format, in a way that matches the expectations of HTML5  tag. Besides, I will also add a few words about Akka and some components like Akka Streams to give you some theoretical background before you start coding. But first, one question.
Why Video Streaming?
There are three main reasons behind choosing video streaming as the topic for today’s article. The first one is that it is an absorbing and complex subject for me, especially on a large scale (like Netflix) and I have always wanted to learn more about it. The next reason is that it is a niche topic, so a project based around video streaming can be a great addition to anyone&#x27;s portfolio - this one is especially important for people who want to start their journey with Scala and Akka. Last but not least it is very interesting way to get familiar with Akka Streams, which in fact makes this whole operation much easier.</span>

                    <span>This blog will guide you through the basic understanding of extractors in Scala.
An extractor is an object that has a method. It takes an object as an input and gives back arguments. Custom extractors are created using the &quot;unapply&quot; method. The method is called extractor because it takes an element of the same set and extracts some of its parts. The method, also called injection, acts as a constructor, takes some arguments, and yields an element of a given set.</span>

Every organization is unique, and every workload has its own utility. That said, we can still have a generalized approach, and we can start by listing a few desirable qualities that you may want from your AWS application:</span>

                    <span>One of the most fascinating aspects of Adobe Document Generation is how incredibly flexible it is. One aspect of the API that can really enhance the final result is the ability to include images in your template. In a typical use case, you would provide a static image defined in your data used with the API. In this blog post I’m going to demonstrate a more advanced example — dynamically generating images, in our case, charts, on the fly.
The Basics
Before we get into a more advanced demo, let’s quickly cover the basics. (My coworker has a very deep look into Document Generation and images you should check out as well.) As our docs describe, using a dynamic image in your Word template requires a few steps.</span>

                    <span>Introduction
Third-party scripts can cause negative load-time effects. Why is this an issue? Well, in Google’s view, a poorly-optimized page should not rank highly. Instead, search results should favor pages with fundamental design strengths—including JavaScript minification, rapid execution time, and render-friendly scripting. 
In reflection of this belief, Google has planned the gradual release of a major update to its search algorithm that is scheduled for June through August of 2021. This update will increase the importance of a page’s loading speed as a contributing factor to a web page’s overall ranking on Google’s search results page.  As a result, how third-party scripts impact page load times is becoming more important than ever.</span>

First of all, the answer is definitely yes. The loading of css will not only block the parsing of HTML, but also block the execution of JS.</span>

                    <span>As a developer, I&#x27;m always excited to attend so many great sessions addressing critical challenges in the Apache Kafka ecosystem. One example is how changes to event-driven APIs are leading developers to focus on contract-first development for Kafka.
This article discusses the journey Kafka users have taken to get on the API bandwagon and how developers are using contracts to describe brokers without losing control of their data in the cluster. A critical component for effective schema governance is having a schema registry such as Apicurio Registry.</span>

Or let’s have a look at another situation: a new feature that changed the business process was developed and tested according to the best software practices, but users struggle to use this feature because they are not sure about the changes this feature brings. Maybe a proper user manual or user training is needed in this case?</span>

                    <span>Today, every business wants to deliver high-quality, easy to use and accessible applications to all sections of society. Delivering seamlessly accessible apps to one and all is not only a requirement for all businesses but is also societal responsibility that should be taken care of.

                    <span>In this article, we look at object-to-object mappers in C# .NET.  Mappers solve the common problem of writing mundane and repetitive code when assigning values between objects.  Three different mapping libraries are evaluated to give an idea of common themes and some differences which might be relevant for your development needs.
The mapping libraries AutoMapper, AgileMapper, and Mapster have been used in a simple demo program to explore some simple mapping scenarios.</span>

                    <span>The Jakarta EE Ambassadors are encouraged by the continued progress and relevance of both Jakarta EE and MicroProfile. We believe a clear, collaborative, and complementary relationship between Jakarta EE and MicroProfile is very important for the Java ecosystem. 
Unfortunately the relationship has been unclear to many in the Java community, sometimes appearing to be disconnected, overlapping and competitive. MicroProfile builds on top of some Jakarta EE specifications and many Jakarta EE applications now use MicroProfile APIs. For the success of both, it is imperative that the technology sets clarify alignment to ensure continuity and predictability.</span>

                    <span>In the previous article, I described the creation of an HTML table report with AJAX filtering and user sorting of columns — using a few lines of code written into a single Java command. For this, I used the ReportBuilder class from the Ujorm framework. Today, I’d like to show you how to place formatted content into the cells of such a table, as well as a few more improvements. What will the final table look like?
Our filter now has a new input field for limiting the number of displayed rows. We can insert the first column into our table, containing the sort order number of the row. The star classification of a hotel can be displayed using a list of appropriate characters with a tooltip, and the final column contains a link to the hotel home page.

To make things worse, a crucial success factor of every Scrum team is not even mentioned in the Scrum Guide: Any organization that wants to employ Scrum to learn faster than its competitors needs to have a solid failure culture.

Here&#x27;s the scenario: You&#x27;re organizing a full-day Minecraft class for local STEM students. You need to run your own Minecraft servers to ensure a kid-friendly multiplayer environment, restricted only to your students. One server won&#x27;t be enough, so you&#x27;ll run two servers simultaneously, expecting your load balancer to handle sending students to Server A or Server B, depending on the load.</span>

                    <span>Amongst various metrics that Kafka monitoring includes consumer lag is nearly the most important of them all. In this post, we will explore potential reasons for Kafka consumer lag and what you could do when you experience lag.
Kafka — Past and Present
Apache Kafka is no longer used just by the Internet hyperscalers. Apache Kafka is used in the enterprise to deal with exploding streaming data. It powers compelling consumer experiences such as real-time personalization, recommendation and next best action. Kafka allows low latency ingestion of large amounts of data into data lakes or data warehouses. Kafka allows businesses to get real-time intelligence into their business operations that allows them to react in real time to changing business conditions.</span>

                    <span>Introduction
Using &quot;sys.objects,&quot; we can get a list of tables and stored Procedures created in the Database. SQL Server now supports table-valued parameters, which allow us to send data tables as parameters to Stored Procedures. It still uses the same ADO.NET API. Using SYSOBJECTS and SYSDEPENDS, we can get all the tables, stored procedures, and other database object-related information.
Description
You can apply the OBJECT_ID, OBJECT_NAME, and OBJECTPROPERTY() built-in functions to the objects shown in sys.objects. It contains a row for each user-defined, schema-scoped object that is created within a database. sys.objects does not show DDL triggers because they are not schema-scoped. Table Valued Parameter allows a table (i.e multiple rows of data) to be passed as a parameter to a stored procedure from T-SQL code or from an application. It was not possible to pass a table variable as a parameter to a stored procedure in old versions of SQL Server.</span>

                    <span>This article is about the prospects of IoT and why we need to build IoT projects. You may think the reason is new technologies like 5G but that is not the case. After the pandemic of last year, we witness an unprecedented usage of the internet and heavy reliance on network-based applications. Today, in 2021, we can say that consumer behavior has changed and it has changed for good. Consumers start relying on IoT devices and that&#x27;s why you need to build one today. Here is why.
Technology Diversity Drives IoT Growth
The Covid-19 pandemic drove companies and consumers to become more technology-reliant. No wonder the IoT grew by double-digit. We witness increasing sophistication of the IoT technology and this trend is going to dominate in the upcoming years. In this part, we will talk about some of the challenges and advantages of technology when it comes to IoT.</span>

                    <span>Background
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) tells us the whole story just by its name — these are exposures and vulnerabilities that are common. But what happens when uncommon issues are discovered and exploited by attackers? What if attackers just want us to think they’d only exploit common issues and vulnerabilities?
Securing CVEs sounds like it should be the right place to start from. Exploring common vulnerabilities and exposure is where script kiddies start from, that&#x27;s what bots are exploiting, and none of us want to end up in the security hall of shame, set aside for organizations that were exploited and affected by ransomware, thanks to an unpatched CVE from months ago.</span>

                    <span>Five years ago, wireless ISP partners were roughly seven to eight miles on average away from their typical subscribers in rural areas. In the last three years of progress since then, wireless ISP partners say they&#x27;re really between three to five miles from their subscribers in rural areas. This means they&#x27;ve been putting a concerted effort of getting closer to these subscribers to provide more serving points to get more capacity and more speed to the subscribe.
Those familiar with the fixed wireless business know that it is traditionally made up of backhaul equipment that delivers bandwidth at a low cost from data centers and tower locations into neighborhoods.</span>

                    <span>Object-Oriented Programming and Design principles have now existed for over 50 years, so it seems odd that apparently, no one has noticed the substantial flaw in Object-Oriented Design that has existed since the very beginning. We are instead told that Object-Oriented (OO) Design principals have won the day, as they provide a programmatic mirror image of the real-world scenarios they are intended to reflect. If we look a little deeper, OO Design is in fact completely detached from the world that it is intended to model. Whilst it is obviously true that the world consists of objects — known and unknown, real and abstract — the unimaginable flaw in OO Design fundamentals that seems to remain undetected until this day is that calling objects can never have complete mastery of the Interfaces of the objects they call: objects can only ever be masters of their own Interface — of themselves.
Example
Let’s imagine a Customer Object in negotiations with a SalesContact Object, in any given IT Landscape. OO Design asks us to pretend that the Customer Object has perfect mastery of the SalesContact Object Interface, and therefore knows exactly how to call the relevant RequestQuotation method of the SalesContact Object: having already guessed at the name of that method, its latest publicly-available version, and based upon the false hope that the definition of the RequestQuotation method will not change over time. The obvious reality is that the Customer Object can only guess at the Interface of the SalesContact Object, and hope that this Interface does not change in the short-term (e.g. as the product range offered by the SalesContact becomes more developed, and therefore more complex). Add to this the fact that the very same Customer Object may need to exchange with several different SalesContact Objects in several different departments, not all using the same Interface Version or even the same Interface — the same API — and we must consider that the OO Design philosophy, as it stands today, is massively flawed.</span>

                    <span>Understanding Canary 
Canary was an essential part of British mining history: these humble birds were used to detect carbon monoxide and other toxic gases before the gases could hurt humans (the canary is more sensitive to airborne toxins than humans). The term “canary analysis” in software deployment serves a similar purpose. Just as the canary notified miners about any problems in the air they breathed, DevOps engineers use a canary deployment analysis to gauge if their new release in CI/CD process will cause any trouble to business.
You can consider the following general definition of a canary release deployment: canary deployment is a technique to reduce the risk of introducing a software update in production by slowly rolling out the change to a small subset of users before making it available to everybody.</span>

                    <span>Azure Synapse Analytics is a new product in the Microsoft Azure portfolio. It brings a whole new layer of control plane over well-known services as SQL Warehouse (rebranded to SQL Provisioned Pool), integrated Data Factory Pipelines, and Azure Data Lake Storage, as well as add new components such as Serverless SQL and Spark Pools. Integrated Azure Synapse Workspace helps handle security and protection of data in one place for all data lake, data analytics, and warehousing needs, but also requires learning some new concepts. At GFT, working with financial institutions all over the world, we pay particular attention to the security aspects of solutions that we provide to our customers. Synapse Analytics is a welcome new tool in this area.
The New Workspace Portal
The first visible difference, when compared to other services, is that Synapse Analytics has a separate Workspace: https://web.azuresynapse.net/ that provides access to code, notebooks, SQL, pipelines, monitoring, and management panels. The portal is available on the public Internet using Azure AD Access controls for controlling access to any Synapse Analytics instance in any tenant that we have access to. However, Synapse Analytics introduces a new way to connect to the portal from Internet-isolated, on-premises networks, and offices using Private Link Hubs. Compared to Private Links that protect access to services and databases, this solution is used for routing traffic to a web portal. In conjunction with the Azure AD Conditional Access policy, the new Synapse Analytics Workspace can be protected with network and authentication policies.</span>

                    <span>You might have previously used observability tools such as Prometheus, Azure Monitor, AWS Container Insight, or commercial products such as Logic Monitor to monitor your Kubernetes cluster. Let&#x27;s probe the Kubernetes magic that makes the beautiful CPU and memory dials tick on the monitoring dashboards.
Kubernetes has a built-in Metrics API (see spec) and a simple CLI query, kubectl top ( documentation), that you can use to fetch a snapshot of the CPU and memory consumption of a Kubernetes object. The Kubernetes Metrics API is dependent on the Metrics Server cluster add-on that gathers resource usage from the Kubelets of the cluster. The primary consumer of the Metrics API is the Horizontal Pod Autoscaler. The Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) uses the metrics served by the Metrics API to scale the number of pods based on the observed resource metrics values. Apart from the Metrics API, HPA is designed to also consume metrics from your application running on the cluster (custom metrics) and services outside the cluster (external metrics) to autoscale pods. Some examples of external metrics provider to HPA are the popular open-source events-based autoscaling service KEDA and soon Logic Monitor. Similar to HPA, Vertical Pod Autoscaler (VPA) relies on Metrics Server as well. VPA allows you to automatically scale the CPU and memory constraints of the containers in a pod.</span>

                    <span>Introduction
A spreadsheet is a particularly useful way to display and exploit tabular data, or just formatted content. Generally, the user will fill in data simply by typing it and modify the properties of cells using the sheet controls.
However, some data types can be challenging for free typing. A date can be easily misinterpreted if the format is incorrect for example. Or you may need the user to freehand a signature before printing.</span>

                    <span>This article contains step-by-step information on running the Mule Application in AWS. Here, Terraform will be used for provisioning AWS resources. Terraform code will help to create an EC2 instance with required inbound and outbound rules and a key pair for logging into the instance, then running script that will set up the run time environment for our Mule Application. Mulesoft has a runtime manager, i.e., CloudHub that can be used to deploy or manage the mule application in a more scalable way. Basically, CloudHub is using the AWS EC2 instance that they call workers in CloudHub to run client applications, though it offers really cool features like proxies, SLAs and etc. The purpose of this tutorial is just to show you an alternative way of running Mule application and After deploying to AWS, You will get a public endpoint for your application that can be tested with any rest client.
Requirements

                    <span>Being able to remotely collaborate on code with your colleagues has never been as essential as it is today. While ad-hoc screen sharing is okay for infrequent use, its capabilities fall far short for longer, more regular sessions. We move then, to code focused, IDE based solutions - there are several of these, but there are very few which support collaboration across multiple IDEs, and only CodeTogether supports Eclipse, IntelliJ and VS Code. This is what we’ll be using to get a collaborative session going, and through this tutorial,  I’ll give you a quick walkthrough of some of its capabilities.  
Installing the Plugin / Extension and Signing Up
CodeTogether can be easily installed from your IDE’s marketplace (IntelliJ, Eclipse, VS Code) - bring up the marketplace dialog from within the IDE, search for and install CodeTogether.</span>

                    <span>This Zato how-to is about ensuring that only API clients with valid SSL/TLS certificates, including expected certificate fingerprints or other metadata, can invoke selected REST endpoints. In this way, we are making access to the endpoints secure and, at the same time, we can guard against a class of faults related to the Certificate Authority infrastructure. 
Overview
Given that in front of all Zato servers in a cluster is a load-balancer, it is the load-balancer that accepts API client connections.</span>

What is Packer?
Packer by HashiCorp is an awesome tool to create pre-configured machine images which can be directly used to create an instance. This should not be seen as a replacement for other configuration tools like Ansible, Chef, etc. Instead, you can use the same tools to pre-configure your image, and with Packer, you can automate the management of your machine images like pushing to an image repository or ensuring your CI pipelines have updated images. Packer also helps you to create parallel builds, i.e you can create multiple images for different platforms using a single template. This enables you to ensure changes in your applications can be tested on multiple platforms simultaneously. It can also be seen as a factor to reduce the parity between developer and production builds.</span>

                    <span>Introduction
Over the last two decades, many application development teams have adopted Agile development practices and have immensely benefited from it. Delivering working software frequently, receiving early feedback from customers and having self-organized cross-functional teams led to faster delivery to market and satisfied customers. Another software engineering culture, called DevOps, started evolving towards the middle of this decade and is now popular among many organizations. DevOps aims at unifyin…</span>

                    <span>For decades, enterprises have developed business-critical applications on various platforms, including physical servers, virtual machines, and cloud environments. The one thing these applications have in common across industries is they need to be continuously available (24x7x365) to guarantee stability, reliability, and performance, regardless of demand. Therefore, every enterprise must be responsible for the high costs of maintaining an infrastructure (e.g., CPU, memory, disk, networking, etc.) even if ac…</span>

Being able to view products and pages liked by other users is not only an interesting exercise, but also a nearly ubiquitous marketing tool — and, it can be easily implemented with MySQL using Arctype.
Nearly every dynamic website uses collaborative filtering to maximize users&#x27; exposure to a wider range of potentially relevant content.  You&#x27;ve seen it on Amazon:</span>

                    <span>Postgres offers set operators that make it easy to query and filter the results of searches from your database. Set operators are used to join the results of two or more SELECT statements. These operators are UNION, UNION ALL, INTERSECT, and EXCEPT-each can be used to construct queries across multiple tables and filter for the specific data that you need.
 
 
To return the combined results of two SELECT statements, we use the UNION set operator. This operator removes all the duplicates from the queried resu…</span>

These attacks can threaten not only servers, but other connected confidential information such as cloud services in AWS, Azure, and OpenStack as well.

                    <span>Introduction
My main job is related to mobile advertising, and from time to time, I have to work with mobile application datasets.
I decided to make some of the data publicly available for those who want to practice building models or get an idea of some of the data that can be collected from open sources. I believe that open-source datasets are always useful as they allow you to learn and grow. Collecting data is often a difficult and dreary job, and not everyone has the ability to do it.</span>

Various vendors added Kafka and related tooling to their offerings or provide a Kafka cloud service. This blog post uses the car analogy - from the motor engine to the self-driving car - to explore the different Kafka offerings available on the market.

According to the 2020 Trustwave Global Security Report, the volume of attacks on cloud services has doubled in 2020 as compared to the last year. Cloud environments are now the third most targete…</span>

I think there are two concepts that are really fundamental: number one, your architecture for your applications will change over time, right?
Your requirements are going to change. You know, what you use for an MVP or a prototype won’t quite be the same thing that you use for, you know, your app with like 400 to 600,000 lines of code with a team of 20 people. Those things are just naturally going to be different from one another.</span>

                    <span>Introduction
As competing cogs in one of the fastest-growing industries within the technology sector, data analysis companies are constantly vying for ways to transform raw SQL queries into impactful visualizations faster and more reliably. Suffice to say, visualization is quite an in-demand skill in today&#x27;s increasingly complex world of data. While this may sound trivial to outsiders, analysts know this is often anything but straightforward.

                    <span>There are plenty of failure possibilities with Scrum. Given that Scrum is a framework with a reasonable yet short “manual,” this effect should not surprise anyone. The Developers Code Fallacy starts with the idea that Developers are rare and expensive and should focus on creating code. Business analysts or customer care agents can talk to customers instead. However, in practice, it has a diminishing effect on a Scrum team’s productivity and creativity. It is a sign for an organization still profoundly stuck…</span>

                    <span>Over the course of my 30+ year career in Information Technology, I have encountered my fair share of proof-of-concept or prototype applications which have found their way into a productional state. This has always been a direct conflict with the original intent of the work that was created.
While this should be considered some form of a compliment for a job well-done, more often than not there are decisions made in those prototyping exercises which are not labeled as production-support friendly. To some deg…</span>

In our post-Equifax world, APIs still fly under the radar of security professionals, and the future will only bring more incidents unless leaders adopt strategies and tactics to mitigate the inherent “openness” of APIs.

The majority of the Rails custom software development work we do here at NextLink Labs deals with rehabilitating older projects that are overwhelmed with technical debt from years of development without refactoring.
The software problems in these websites are never introduced maliciously. Instead, these problems tend to build up gradually over months and years after many rushed deadlines, strict client demands that don&#x27;t allow for refactoring, and inexperienced Rails developers trying their bes…</span>

In my previous post about Node.js — Dependency Management, we looked at the basics of what is Node.js module. How can we use module.exports and require to work with dependencies. How folder dependencies work and why they are useful. We all look at how the Node.js lookup system works to look for dependencies and some basics of NPM.
Today we will continue from that point and see how we use this module system to break down an application into multiple modules. What are the benefits of doing so and…</span>

                    <span>Configuring the database connections pool for the Rails app might not be a straightforward task for many programmers. There is a constraint of max opened connections on a database level. Your server environment configuration can change in time and affect the number of connections to the database required. For instance number of servers you use can change when you autoscale it based on the web traffic. It means that the number of web processes/threads running for Puma or Unicorn servers could change.

And one of the fastest and most enjoyable ways to keep learning is to attend events on new technologies and trends. Keeping in mind the unstable situation with Coronavirus, many events have decided to shift to virtual or hybrid format this year.

                    <span>Pair programming has a long and respectable history. Frederic &#x27;No Silver Bullet&#x27; Brooks practiced it as early as 1953. It makes Scrum, CI/CD, and BDD look like recent fads by comparison. I’ve worked in teams where the latter were practiced with a good deal of commitment and success, but pair programming has never been popular. I am not surprised. I must have racked up no more than a week of solid pairing during 22 years as a developer and I wasn’t convinced of the alleged benefits.

Here the target is strimzi and the source is a standalone Kafka cluster.  Target means where data has to be copied and the source is from where we want to copy/migrate data. I have an article on how to use mirrormaker with apache kafka clusters about mirrormaker version 1. This article is about mirrormaker 2, which has more features than mirrormaker1.

                    <span>Developers are working with new applications every day using Apache Kafka as the backbone to implement an event-driven architecture (EDA) to support distributed systems. However, this adds new challenges when sharing across teams, even within the same organization. What endpoints are available? What is the structure of the message? That’s why payload examples became critical to speed up development. For this reason, having a reliable and enterprise-grade service to mock Apache Kafka should be an item in you…</span>

It’s often the case that vulnerable groups are the first to benefit from new technological advances, and that has held true for the evolution of IoT devices. Many of the solutions available in the market today can be practical for the general consumer, but they truly shine when used to help senior citizens and other vulnerable groups live safer and more independent lives.

However, in a bid to stay relevant to consumers amidst competition, companies try to bundle up a million features together rather than offer a full-proof and specific solution for a certain user need.

Too often, companies hire specialists, collect data from many sources and analyze it for no clear purpose. And without a clear purpose, all your efforts are in vain. You can take in more customer information than all your competitors and still fail to make practical use of it.</span>

The general task of data processing is to derive new data from these multiple tables and each solid data (processing) model must answer the following three important questions: how to compute new columns within one table, how to link tables and…</span>

                    <span>Introduction
As in my previous blog where I explained how I came to know if my system is hacked or compromised (link here). Here in this blog, I will explain what basic things we can check on our system when we have doubt if our system is compromised.
This blog has 3 parts. In this part, we look at a list of checks which can determine if a system is compromised or hacked.</span>

                    <span>As we all know and firmly believe, applications and infrastructures need to be secured, but the shipping processes of this whole ecosystem also need to be.
In a previous article, we introduced GitOps as a methodology to improve the velocity of the development and the management of an entire infrastructure. But there are many other benefits from GitOps, and one of them is the potential improvement of security.</span>

                    <span>In a Cloud Microservices Market report, it was found that the cloud microservices market was valued at USD 831.45 billion in 2020, and it is expected to reach USD 2,701.36 billion by 2026. This is a clear indication of how microservices are currently driving the market, encouraging organizations to break their applications into smaller components and leave their &quot;traditional&quot; monolithic architecture behind.
However, before we dismiss monoliths entirely, cloud architect and author Rahul Rai argues how micros…</span>

                    <span>Apache Kafka was open-sourced by LinkedIn in early 2011. Despite all the initial limitations, it was a huge success and it became the de-facto standard for streaming data. The performance, possibility to replay events and multiple consumers independently were some of the features which disrupted the streaming arena.
But Kafka has been also known for its difficult learning curve and difficulties with the operation. In my experience, both things are improved a lot in the last few years but the original gotcha…</span>

Despite our best efforts, the database will accept plenty of garbage data if you let it. There are tons of methods to bypass the Rails callbacks and validations while still updating your database. If you are like me you have probably used these methods in the Rails console to fix some of that funky data you found after some other code created it in the first place.

As testing has to be performed on varied combinations, it can lead to code duplication as a lot of test methods will be doing the same thing but on different input combinations.

It commonly serves for gathering important information from end-users that can trigger updates on the client-side or be stored in the database on the server-side. Poorly designed or confusing forms can cause a lot of inconvenience to end-users and application owners. Therefore, it is necessary to pay serious attention to the proper implementation of forms and their features such as labels, notifications, validation r…</span>

                    <span>An in-memory data grid (IMDG) is a set of networked/clustered computers that pool together their random access memory (RAM) to let applications share data with other applications running in the cluster. Though IMDGs are sometimes generically described as a distributed in-memory data store, IMDGs offer more than just storage. IMDGs are built for data processing at extremely high speeds. They are designed for building and running large-scale applications that need more RAM than is typically available in a sin…</span>

Testing an asset is a crucial phase for most human activities. As humans, we are able to define very complex algorithms and to design intricate domains with several different possible states. There are no boundaries on what we can create and design. On the other side, as humans, we make mistakes. It represents the main friction to our creativity. Usually, during a creative activity, questions like the following may arise:

Am I considering all reachable status?

Shopify Plus is a one-size-fits-all platform that allows you to use headless systems while retaining most of its features. So if you already have a Shopify Plus setup, you can keep the frontend and migrate the backend to a microservices-based alternative for more flexibil…</span>

                    <span>The serverless journey started with functions - small snippets of code running on-demand and a short period in Figure 1.  AWS Lambda in the “1.0” phase made this paradigm very popular, but it had its limitations around execution time, protocols, and poor local development experience. 
Since then, developers realized that the same serverless traits and benefits could be applied to microservices and Linux containers. This leads us into what we&#x27;re calling the “1.5” phase in Figure 1.  Some serve…</span>

There is a rise in industry-specific data analytics solutions because building up and maintaining custom data warehouses is difficult. It requires extensive development and operational efforts to define the appropriate industry-specific data model for the business intelligence tools, follow all the shape changes over time (new tables, new columns, new relationships) and design the ETL processes for a wide variety of data sources.

                    <span>Introduction
Spring security provides a mechanism to control and limit the maximum number of single-user open sessions. This mechanism prevents users from exceeding the number of allowed simultaneous connections.

As consumers, we perceive value based on how much we can decode the ingredient labels and match it to the price at which it is offered. While it’s easy to relate an ingredient like refined sugar to unhealthiness, it’s another thing to rightly estimate the hidden price that you pay for consuming that sugary food.

                    <span>There are many reasons why Linux is such a popular platform for processing Internet of Things (IoT) edge applications. A major one is a transparency. Linux security capabilities are built on open source projects, giving users a transparent view of security risks and threats and enables them to apply fixes quickly with security module patches or kernel-level updates. Another Linux advantage is that developers can choose from various programming languages to develop, test, and run device communications over v…</span>

As everything is digitized now, especially after the Covid pandemic, it is now even more important to properly manage the IT infrastructure of an organization.
Earlier, this management of IT infrastructure was done manually by the system administrators. They managed all the hardware and software that was required for an application to run. Tech has progressed a lot in the past few years, and now there is an alternative to this manual management, called Infrastructure as Code or IaC in short.</span>

Neural Nets have become pretty popular today, but there remains a dearth of understanding about them. For one, we&#x27;ve seen a lot of people not being able to recognize the various types of neural networks and the problems they solve, let alone distinguish between each of them. And second, which is somehow even worse, is when people indiscriminately use the words Deep Learning when talking about any neural network without breaking down the differences.

Abstract
In relational database systems, SQL is more than a declarative query language. It includes procedural language (T-SQL, PL/SQL, etc) and defines transactions and their semantics. SQL as a query language has been unreasonably effective even in NoSQL database systems. However, few NoSQL database systems support transactions.

Elastic Stack is a group of open-source tools that includes Elasticsearch for supporting data ingestion, storage, enrichment, visualization, and analysis for containerized applications. As a distributed search and analytics engine, Elasticsearch is an open-source tool that ingests application data, indexes it then stores it for analytics.
Since it gathers large volumes of data while indexing different data types, Elasticsearch is often considered write-heavy. To manage such dynamic volumes of data,…</span>

                    <span>Whether you rely on them for business or personal use, it’s safe to say that we interact with URLs on a daily basis. They are our gateway to provide and access information across the web, and due to their universal nature, they are constantly scrutinized by attackers for security vulnerabilities. One type of risk that can be difficult to identify is if your URL is a server administration path; if it is, it could become a potential target for remote access attacks. To clarify, server administration paths are…</span>

This can be especially helpful when trying to accomplish complicated processes, like those that SQL Server isn’t well suited to handle. CTEs make challenges easier to solve by breaking difficult operations into two distinct steps.

For example, you can dive right into the console, or use approaches like Chalice or the Serverless Framework, to name a few. For me, the latest way, announced at re:Invent 2020, is the most efficient way of testing your serverless function locally and dealing with large or awkward dependencies in your code.

According to IDC, global spending on artificial intelligence systems is forecast to reach €31 billion in 2019, a 44% increase from 2018 spending. For any business that hasn&#x27;t started its AI journey, it&#x27;s time to look into the opportunities it provides.

Contrary to logs and observability, which shows what happens on a service, tracing allows developers and operators to follow a specific request and how it calls different services and dependencies.

Firstly, of course, we have to initialize our string. What is a string used for?
You want to look at your string as a line, not as a mass of symbols.
If you have a long text, you want to work with the words, not the letters.
If you have lots of information, you need functions that solve questions as quickly as possible.

                    <span>Embracing DevOps is essential, but keeping the software delivery and deployment pipeline safe has become more critical than ever. While attackers are keen on getting into your Docker containers or Kubernetes clusters, it is highly recommended to secure your images, pods, and clusters, which poses a nightmare to the attackers. Securing your artifacts, deployment workloads, production environments is what is taking the limelight today. While we have many tools to get the job done, it is vital to understand De…</span>

                    <span>When the pandemic first started causing widespread infections and illness, governments around the world enacted drastic safety measures — lockdowns, deferral of elected surgeries, etc. — to contain the spread and, critically, to prevent healthcare systems from being overrun. The lockdowns should’ve helped the healthcare system &#x27;catch up,&#x27; but a lack of technological solutions and agility prevented healthcare systems from using this time to update their tech stack.

                    <span>Introduction
An important concept in Node.js is that you want to know the way dependency management is handled. This dependency management is part of the core Node.js experience. In this post, we will learn the various patterns of dependency management and how Nodejs load dependencies.
So, we could write our application using a single js file for everything, but that’s not modular. Node.js makes it very simple to write modular code.</span>

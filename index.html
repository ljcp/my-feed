                <p>The Relationship Between Automated Testing and RPA
 Automated testing is a process of transforming a human-driven test system into machine execution. RPA is developed from automated testing, similar to automated testing, and there is a lot of overlap between the two. For example, they all drive screens, keyboards, mice, etc., and have similar technical architectures. However, RPA is different from automated testing, and there are many differences between the two:

We’ll initially deploy to a local cluster before stepping things up and deploying to Azures manged Kubernetes Service, AKS. By the end of this post you should have two Spring Boot services deployed to an AKS cluster as shown in the diagram below.</p>

In this first post we’ll create a Config Service that pulls its data from a Git repo and exposes it to other services. We’ll also create a consumer, a Config Consumer Service that pulls from the Config Service on startup. The diagram below shows how the services will interact.

                <p>Multi-writer replication has been a challenge in the MySQL ecosystem for years before truly dedicated solutions were introduced – first Galera (and so Percona XtradDB Cluster (PXC)) replication (around 2011), and then Group Replication (first GA in 2016).
Now, with both multi-writer technologies available, do we still need traditional asynchronous replication, set up in active-active topology? Apparently yes, there are still valid use cases. And you may need it not only when for some reason Galera/PXC or GR…</p>

Managed Services
There are multiple ways to use Kafka in the cloud. One way is to use IBM’s managed&nbsp;Event Streams service or Red Hat’s managed service&nbsp;OpenShift Streams for Apache Kafka. The big advantage of managed services is that you don’t have to worry about managing, operating, and maintaining the messaging systems.

One solution is to use HTTPS connections instead. We can also authenticate those requests with an Authenti…</p>

                <p>In this tweet, I was asked if I had a list of resources for developers who are new to Java. I didn't at the time, but I've spent some time researching, and here is that list.

                    <span>The serverless journey started with functions - small snippets of code running on-demand and a short period in Figure 1.  AWS Lambda in the “1.0” phase made this paradigm very popular, but it had its limitations around execution time, protocols, and poor local development experience. 
Since then, developers realized that the same serverless traits and benefits could be applied to microservices and Linux containers. This leads us into what we&#x27;re calling the “1.5” phase in Figure 1.  Some serve…</span>

                    <span>Many large healthcare organizations are adopting RPA leading to digitalization which can lead to healthy competition between medical services. The use of disruptive science and technology can make the healthcare industry more efficient. Using RPA can perfectly automate the query tasks of Electronic Health Record data, partner ecosystem, financial and accounting systems, and payment personnel letter, thereby reducing the workload of medical personnel.

That&#x27;s because we live in a highly competitive world where, in order to become a leader, organizations need a differentiator that sets them apart.

No CPU requests or low CPU requests specified for workloads, which means more Pods “seem” to be able to work on the same node. During traffic bursts, your CPU is maxed out with a longer delay while some of your machines may have a CPU soft lockup.

There is a rise in industry-specific data analytics solutions because building up and maintaining custom data warehouses is difficult. It requires extensive development and operational efforts to define the appropriate industry-specific data model for the business intelligence tools, follow all the shape changes over time (new tables, new columns, new relationships) and design the ETL processes for a wide variety of data sources.

Working with a collection of values (key/value pairs, arrays) is an oft-repeated need in programming. Kumologica provides the Split and Join nodes that can be paired together to loop through data collections.
In this article, we will look into the scenarios in which Split and Join nodes can be used in Kumologica flows.</span>

                    <span>Introduction
Spring security provides a mechanism to control and limit the maximum number of single-user open sessions. This mechanism prevents users from exceeding the number of allowed simultaneous connections. For example, Netflix limits the number of screens you can watch at the same time according to your subscription plan.
In part 1, we will understand how this mechanism works, how to use it, and being aware of the default spring security implementation limitations. In part 2, we will see how to overc…</span>

As everything is digitized now, especially after the Covid pandemic, it is now even more important to properly manage the IT infrastructure of an organization.
Earlier, this management of IT infrastructure was done manually by the system administrators. They managed all the hardware and software that was required for an application to run. Tech has progressed a lot in the past few years, and now there is an alternative to this manual management, called Infrastructure as Code or IaC in short.</span>

Neural Nets have become pretty popular today, but there remains a dearth of understanding about them. For one, we&#x27;ve seen a lot of people not being able to recognize the various types of neural networks and the problems they solve, let alone distinguish between each of them. And second, which is somehow even worse, is when people indiscriminately use the words Deep Learning when talking about any neural network without breaking down the differences.

Abstract
In relational database systems, SQL is more than a declarative query language. It includes procedural language (T-SQL, PL/SQL, etc) and defines transactions and their semantics. SQL as a query language has been unreasonably effective even in NoSQL database systems. However, few NoSQL database systems support transactions.

One is to actually store files, just as we do on a hard disk.

                    <span>Overview
Elastic Stack is a group of open-source tools that includes Elasticsearch for supporting data ingestion, storage, enrichment, visualization, and analysis for containerized applications.

                    <span>Lead developers are the main people behind product development. They have a unique perspective and insight to share with those who are looking for career advice. So, I decided to start interviewing CTOs and Lead Developers instead of CEOs and CMOs, all of whom have had their own diverse career paths before arriving at this position. 
The first person I interviewed was Amit Debnath, a lead developer who has been in the industry for 12 years now. He says that he loves coding because it&#x27;s &quot;a series of puz…</span>

Let’s pretend the data provision service already exists. If we wanted to offer our users some simple (sequential) content filtering for a table with column sorting, our implementation will have to add a few extra lines of code. To optimize this filtering, we’ll need to dig deeper into the backend. The web component takes its data from an…</span>

                    <span>Whether you rely on them for business or personal use, it’s safe to say that we interact with URLs on a daily basis. They are our gateway to provide and access information across the web, and due to their universal nature, they are constantly scrutinized by attackers for security vulnerabilities. One type of risk that can be difficult to identify is if your URL is a server administration path; if it is, it could become a potential target for remote access attacks. To clarify, server administration paths are…</span>

                    <span>One powerful feature of Microsoft SQL Server is common table, which lets you store a temporary result and execute a statement after using that result set. This can be especially helpful when trying to accomplish complicated processes, like those that SQL Server isn’t well suited to handle. CTEs make challenges easier to solve by breaking difficult operations into two distinct steps.
In this tutorial, you will learn how to use Microsoft SQL Server to write common table expressions. Next, you will learn how t…</span>

                    <span>One of the best things about AWS Lambda is the variety of ways that you can create a serverless function. For example, you can dive right into the console, or use approaches like Chalice or the Serverless Framework, to name a few. For me, the latest way, announced at re:Invent 2020, is the most efficient way of testing your serverless function locally and dealing with large or awkward dependencies in your code. As you’d expect, this works perfectly with AWS SAM. This post will give you a quickstart into wha…</span>

                    <span>This is the third article of the series. The first article is about integrating Bing Maps with Angular and Spring Boot with Jpa. The second article is about adding a new shape to the map and storing it in the Spring Boot backend.
This article is about removing properties of a map with a modal panel to confirm and delete it in the database. The project AngularAndSpringWithMaps is used as an example. To remove a property the property has to be clicked on.</span>

                    <span>The initial stages of the Agile software development journey can be exciting. It’s a time of possibility and experimentation.
But these feelings start to wane when stakeholders try to figure out the cost of getting the project from 0 to 100. The team might want to play with a couple of automation tools, but they require an extra set of expert hands. Or there’s some research worth stretching out, but that means more data and more man-hours.</span>

While building multiple apps, you will come across reusable code. This common code can be packaged, versioned, and hosted so that it can be reused within the organization. 
Azure DevOps Artifacts is a service that is part of the Azure DevOps toolset, which allows organizations to create and share libraries securely within the organization.</span>

                    <span>In our series of chaos engineering articles, we have been learning to simulate various performance problems. In this post, let’s discuss how to simulate a StackOverflow error. A StackOverflow error is a runtime error. In this post, we&#x27;ll simulate a StackOverflowError, diagnose it, and solve the problem.
Sample Program
Here is a sample program from the open source BuggyApp application, which would generate java.lang.StackOverflowError.</span>

I&#x27;ll be using Python code examples, but you can easily adapt this tutorial to your language of choice.

Contrary to logs and observability, which shows what happens on a service, tracing allows developers and operators to follow a specific request and how it calls different services and dependencies.

Latest Tag Is Broken at Best, Evil at Worst
It seems like the “latest” tag should work, but it really doesn’t, except in the simplest cases. We didn’t realize how crazy broken this could be until one night we were on a Zoom call and watched a new customer install software that was three months old, when there were 10 newer builds available.

Firstly, of course, we have to initialize our string. What is a string used for?
You want to look at your string as a line, not as a mass of symbols.
If you have a long text, you want to work with the words, not the letters.
If you have lots of information, you need functions that solve questions as quickly as possible.

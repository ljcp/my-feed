        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As we have discussed in previous articles, while the Word DOCX format is the go-to for creating text documents, it can be insufficient when we enter the web-based territory. When considering formatting for online documents, it is Hyper Text Markup Language (HTML) that emerges as one of the clear winners for applications and websites. This dynamic language utilizes set cues or elements to construct documents that can be transmitted to browsers and presented to end-users as a readable web page. The structure of HTML even allows for the integration of images, interactive forms, and other objects that are more difficult to create with a straightforward Word document.
The Word DOCX format is actually based on a different markup language, XML (Extensible Markup Language).  Microsoft transitioned its most popular programs – Word, Excel, and PowerPoint – to an open standard, XML-based format in the mid-2000s. This move was to create improvements in file size, image compression, and security, as well as to maintain an edge over their competitors. While some users still prefer the older DOC version due to its compatibility with other platforms, the DOCX format is generally the better choice for current word processing projects.]]></summary>

Hackers are unfortunately attaining benefit from this immensely produced data, due to which an increasing amount of data breaching activities are happening all across the globe. Recently in March 2021, 20 million records were breached and the number is estimated to increase in the upcoming years. This all boils us down to the reality check that it’s high time for enterprises to attain appropriate solutions to combat illegal activities.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Lots of independent developers use GitHub or its equivalents to host their code repositories. And since they're simple to use and well understood by the public, that's a great idea. But as anyone who's ever created a project that attracted a whole lot of attention can attest, the platforms aren't well-suited to distributing binaries and other software releases.
In most cases, GitHub projects that post binaries do so by having a single server or VPS get triggered by a webhook to compile whatever binaries the project requires. And that means every time a user tries to download the resultant binaries, they’ll be making requests to that same single server instance. That's both inefficient and a recipe for download problems.]]></summary>

You would find it annoying when you come across broken hyperlinks, which is the sole reason why you should continuously focus on removing the existence of broken links in your web product (or website). Instead of a manual inspection, you can leverage automation for broken link testing using Selenium WebDriver.
When a particular link is broken and a visitor lands on the page, it affects that page’s functionality and results in a poor user experience. Dead links could hurt your product’s credibility, as it ‘might’ give an impression to your visitors that there is a minimal focus on the experience.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This post explores use cases and architectures for processing data in motion with Apache Kafka in Industrial IoT (IIoT) across verticals such as automotive, energy, steel manufacturing, oil&gas, cybersecurity, shipping, logistics. Use cases include predictive maintenance, quality assurance, track and track, real-time locating system (RTLS), asset tracking, customer 360, and more. Examples include BMW, Bosch, Baader, Intel, Porsche, and Devon.
Why Kafka Is a Key Piece of the Evolution for Industrial IoT and Manufacturing
Industrial IoT was a mess of monolithic and proprietary technologies in the last decades. Modbus, Siemens S7, SCADA, and similar "concepts" controlled the industry. Vendors locked in enterprises by intentionally building incompatible products without open interfaces. These systems still run on Windows XP or similar non-supported outdated operating systems and without security in mind.]]></summary>

The talk is based on a demo migrating from Spring WebMVC to Spring WebFlux in a step-by-step approach. One of the steps involves installing BlockHound: it allows to check whether a blocking call occurs in a thread it shouldn't happen and throws an exception at runtime when it happens.
I've presented this talk several times in the previous week, both in its Java version and its Kotlin one. One such presentation was at Javaday Istanbul. After the talk, one of the questions I received was, "How does BlockHound work?" I admit that at the time, I couldn't remember. After the surprise had passed, but too late, I remembered it involved a Java agent. But I wanted to go down the rabbit hole.]]></summary>

It has more than 12 million users worldwide and there are over 800,000 server instances deployed that are being used to exchange confidential information and files. My security research team and I discovered critical vulnerabilities in its source code that could have been used by an attacker to take complete control over a server, starting with as little as any user’s email address. 
In this blog post, I investigate these vulnerabilities by first taking a quick look at NoSQL databases, then explain how injections look like in that context. I then analyze the found vulnerabilities and how they can be chained for an exploit. Finally, I give advice on how to prevent such bugs in your applications.]]></summary>

Why do some people find SAFe to be helpful in empowering teams while others find implementing the Framework painful? To be honest, both scenarios are equally valid.
As I was beginning to refocus my career on transforming the operating models and management structures of large enterprises, I found that the behavioral patterns of Agile and the operational cadence of Scrum shined a spotlight on an organization's greatest challenges. As a byproduct of working faster and focusing on flow, impediments became obvious. With the issues surfaced, management had a choice: fix the problems or don’t.]]></summary>

The Background
At the base of Carbon’s real-time, first-party data platform is our analytics component, which combines a range of behavioral, contextual, and revenue data, which is then displayed within a dashboard in a series of charts, graphs, and breakdowns to give a visual representation of the most important actionable data. Whilst we pre-calculate as much of the information as possible, there are different filters that allow users to drill deeper into the data, which makes querying critical.]]></summary>

Speed, innovation, and creativity: It's exactly these things most corporations are desperately lacking. In turn, it's only logical for big companies to want to take a leaf out of the startups' book. Where the clumsy imitation of a start-up mentality fails or maybe isn't even an option, the magic word agile soon echoes through the aisles. Because you know, the competition is already successfully agile, every consultant can deliver ready-made, highly scaled agile wonders on demand in no time at all, and even the house and farm service provider has had experience with it for a long time, but simply wasn't asked about it until now. So "agile" gets written on the banner, swarms of self-proclaimed evangelists get unleashed onto the staff and off they go on a journey into a brighter future.]]></summary>

The rate at which fraudulent activities are evolving is directly proportional to the momentum at which technology is progressing. Also, the data production rate is increasing with the progression of the human population. Do you know that 2.5 quadrillion bytes of information are generated each day? 
Considering the rate at which data is produced and utilized all across the globe, the acquisition of sophisticated measures for the protection of such data is something that must not be neglected by enterprises of all sizes at any cost. Keeping in view the swift pace of progression in identity theft cases, robust mechanisms such as real-time identity verification solutions, especially document verification must be incorporated for the enhancement of security protocols and to combat illicit money transfers, counterfeits, chargebacks, and other relevant fraudulent activities.]]></summary>

With skyrocketing data scale and stringent requirements on data freshness, big data-related scenarios are becoming complicated and multi-dimensional. Thus, many companies use real-time data warehouses to meet their business demand.
But data warehouses are not the only option. An emerging category of databases, Hybrid Analytical/Transactional Processing (HTAP) databases, can serve you just as well as data warehouses, if not better. HTAP databases can handle Online Transactional Processing (OLTP) workloads and respond quickly to big data analytical requests in real time.]]></summary>

A robust incident management strategy eventually leads to better management and handling of issues. It is an essential part of reliability engineering, ensuring that a team is prepared to manage incidents. It can prevent the loss of millions of dollars in revenue in times of breaches or downtimes. Good incident management improves customer experience and empowers engineering teams to meet their uptime goals. 
In this blog, we will discuss how companies can identify and prioritize incidents for faster resolution. Incidents could vary a lot on the surface level, and hence it is essential to classify them according to specific, well-defined parameters. All incidents are not equal. For instance, a system outage during peak hours is much more stressful than handling when most customers are asleep.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A method is a contract; when we define one, we put our thoughts into it. We specify the parameters with their type and also a return type. When we invoke a method, we expect it to behave according to the contract. If it doesn’t, it’s a violation of the contract.
We deal with such a violation all the time. We invoke a method with its proper arguments, and we get a return. However, sometimes we end up getting a null, which is, in fact, a clear violation. We shouldn’t accept such a violation. If a method cannot return the value of the specified type, it should mention that in the method signature, the method may or may not be returning the value you are expecting. If we know it from the method signature, we then write our code accordingly.]]></summary>

He lives 200 meters away from me, and serves half the village I live in with internet. A long time ago before traditional ISP companies even bothered to offer internet in the village, Marco installed antennas around the entire village, offered internet services to all who wanted it, and is today the largest ISP in my village. Today of course we've got several huge ISPs in Cyprus, but nobody really care. We've got Marco, and we're happy with using his internet. He was there for us when nobody else cared, so why would we want to switch to some huge giga corporation today?
When the big banks stopped allowing people to pay their bills over the counter, Marco stepped in, and is now paying people's bills too. Need your bills paid? Drop by at Marco's internet store, leave enough cash to cover your bill, add 2 EURO commission on top, and your bills are paid within a day or two. Needless to say, but for the older people in my village, such an offer is precious, since most of the really old people in my village don't even know how to pay their bills online.]]></summary>

Overview
It is intended for architects and developers to use this information to guide their integration solutions. Once an integration style has been selected, they should review the associated integration style section to understand the typical patterns relevant to that integration style, abide by the constraints and review the implementation considerations.
Understanding “Integration” – Applications, Integration, and Microservices
There is an important distinction around the responsibilities of an integration system and applications. Integration facilitates the transmission of information between systems and may be realized through the use of technologies such as messaging systems, API gateways, and their associated protocols (MQ, AMQP, HTTP, FTP). Over the years, many technology vendors have implemented additional capabilities within their integration products that have enabled developers to add business logic embedded within the integration solution. This has resulted in business logic being spread outside of the application layer and integration an integration system that is often managed and maintained by a single team resulting in a resource bottleneck.]]></summary>

How to do that depends on the API style, API technology, and the specific API design. In all these cases, this part of API design needs to be addressed as part of the overall design work.
For APIs using the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), some minimal reporting can be done using HTTP’s status codes. HTTP status codes are interesting because they already provide a certain level of details, with ~60 different codes reporting a variety of conditions which are defined by HTTP itself and a few other specifications.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[What is a Graceful Shutdown?
The Graceful and the Hard (or Abrupt) shutdown are the two methods of stopping an application. When an application is running, it performs certain tasks or processes client requests. While doing so, it consumes various resources, makes connections, persists data, and/or handles transactions, etc. We may want to stop a running application, in order to take it out of the system or to release a different version of the application, as part of the deployment. However, it is important to analyze and understand the consequences of abruptly stopping an application, and such consequences are purely based on the application functionality and its role in the overall system.
In order to explain in detail, the Graceful vs Hard or abrupt stopping of an application is similar to stopping a computer. When we use the shutdown function of an operating system it prompts for any unsaved work or closing of some important applications. In contrast, when we do a Hard shutdown, we lose any unsaved files or unfinished works. Interestingly, the same logic applies to applications. Some applications are capable of resuming any unfinished tasks when they are restarted. Thus, for such applications, abrupt stops don’t cause any harm. On the other hand, for some applications, an abrupt shutdown may result in unwanted outcomes. For example, failure of very large transactions, or opened resources, etc. Thus, while writing an application we should also pay attention to its shutdown procedure.]]></summary>

This post discusses the instances that put a SQL Server 2014 database in recovery mode and what causes the database to get stuck in recovery. Also, it discusses the methods to restore the database. 
You may find a SQL Server 2014 database in recovery mode when you restart the SQL Server service or restore a database from SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS). Also, a database goes into recovery mode if you restart a system abnormally. The database goes into recovery in such a scenario until all the active transactions are committed or rolled back. Let the recovery process complete, and the database comes back online.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Understanding how to convert between complex file types will allow you to optimize and perfect your operations, ensuring your data is always in the appropriate form. The two formats featured in today’s tutorial are JSON and XML. Both formats are widely used in web-based applications, but one may be more ideal than the other for certain objects. JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) is defined as an open standard file and data-interchange format that uses human-readable text to store and exchange data. It was initially developed from JavaScript, but as a language-independent format it can be used in many different programming languages. Due to its versatility, efficient design, and low cost, JSON has become a go-to for many businesses. 
Our other format, Extensible Markup Language (XML), is similar to JSON in that they both are easy to read, create, and decode. However, XML uses prescribed tags that divide information according to its traits and has limiting factors associated with characters (i.e. !”*(), etc.). While this option may contain a higher word count due to the tags, it does allow for more precision in how data is read by the computer, including improved metadata usability, which is unavailable in JSON.]]></summary>

In this highly engaging speaker session from the Agile Camp Berlin 2021, Jutta Eckstein and Maryse Meinen point out the advantages of creating diverse, cross-functional teams to benefit your customers and your organization.
The Benefits of Creating Real Cross-Functional Teams
At the core of agile development are self-organizing cross-functional teams. Yet, this is often understood as e.g., backend and front-end developers working together. If an organization is aiming for company-wide agility, to fully benefit from agility it has to enable teams as value centers that are truly cross-functional by bringing in different perspectives from business, markets, cultures, beliefs, etc. This way cross-functional teams overcome not only the limitations of organizational silos but also of a singular view on the market.]]></summary>

Wasm is designed as a portable compilation target for programming languages, enabling deployment on the web for client and server applications. At Solo.io, we are very excited about Web Assembly as a way to extend our Envoy Proxy-based API Gateway (Gloo Edge) and the most popular Service Mesh (Istio). We recently made it very easy to use WebAssembly with Gloo Edge and Gloo Mesh.
This is the last blog post of a series about Gloo Edge scalability. In the first blog post, Envoy at Scale with Gloo Edge, we performed benchmarks to determine how Gloo Edge was able to scale in terms of Requests Per Second (RPS.) We also provided information about the throughput one can expect based on the number of CPUs allocated to the gateway-proxy (Envoy) pod.]]></summary>

At the same time, the best APIs are designed to be fully automated without requiring human intervention. This can leave your customers in the dark on whether your API is even being used by the organization and if you’re meeting any SLA obligations in your enterprise contracts.
Types of metrics to surface
Most API first companies have some sort of developer portal for customers to log into, manage API keys, and customize features. This area is a great way to also expose key metrics to your customers demonstrating how much value they are getting from your API. This can be as simple as a counter showing number of API transactions made within a billing period or provide additional metrics around what those transactions are. Each customer has different metrics they want to look at. Developers will want to look at access logs where as product and engineering leadership are more interested in usage and performance metrics. Finally, the finance department may need to look at billing usage for capacity and financial planning.]]></summary>

Despite the benefits, implementing these processes has been perceived as a complex, on-premises project that takes an army of consultants to deploy. While this can be true in some cases, 76% of enterprise organizations are looking to replace their existing identity governance and administration (IGA) system (Gartner). 
This number and other recent research proves we need to find ways to make identity governance more approachable in order for businesses to realize its true value. Fortunately, there are proactive steps companies can take to ensure identity governance is ingrained in their business strategy without the headaches. And it starts with four proactive approaches any business can take to achieve long-term, continual success.]]></summary>

Suffice it to say that it takes some navigation to understand the landscape across all the database flavors. And mere understanding doesn’t necessarily lead to the right choice.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Big Data faces an ironic small file problem that hampers productivity and wastes valuable resources.
If not managed well, it slows down the performance of your data systems and leaves you with stale analytics. This kind of defeats the purpose, doesn’t it? HDFS stores small files inefficiently, leading to inefficient Namenode memory utilization and RPC calls, block-scanning throughput degradation, and reduced application layer performance. If you are a big data administrator on any modern data lake, you will invariably come face to face with the problem of small files. Distributed file systems are great but let's face it, the more you split storage layers the greater your overhead is when reading those files. So the idea is to optimize the file size to best serve your use case, while also actively optimizing your data lake.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Microservices architecture helps in building an application as a suite of multiple fine-grained smaller services. Each of these services run in its own process and are independently deployable. They may have been developed in different programming languages and may use different data storage techniques and communicate with each other via lightweight mechanisms like RESTful APIs, message queues etc. Now that services(API clients) need to know how to interact with each other, there is a need of API documentation that should be clear, informative, and easy to go through.
OpenAPI makes documenting these RESTful services very easy and can be done by adding few annotations to a Spring-based project. Besides rendering documentation, it allows the API consumers to interact with the APIs without having their own implementation logic in place. Also, it can be used to generate the API client libraries for over 50+ languages. In this post, I’ll cover how to use OpenAPI to generate REST API documentation and Java clients for a Spring Boot project.]]></summary>

There are several languages, a framework which built an out-of-the-box connector for MongoDB just like how JDBC connectors help to connect Java programs to an RDBMS, for example, Mongoose as a module under NodeJS, available through npm and this is one of the key components in MEAN (MongoDB, Express, AngularJS, Node.js) or MERN (MongoDB, Express, ReactJS, Node.js) stacks.
Over the years many such platforms have realized that just having a database will not help to build the platform, the need is to help build a Cloud Native solution with Database-as-a-Service aka DaaS is the future. This means the platform needs to support API as the key enabler to connect to various consumers. The classical way to use an on-premise installation with SDK based connector will not stand long in this "Journey to Cloud" era.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The network model for security fails in the cloud. While the old on-prem model made sense in the earlier days of computing, the rapidly expanding suite of cloud providers, along with their infinite combinations of settings and services, now places an extraordinary burden on security teams to become cloud-centric. An enterprise that doesn't fully understand its role in securing its data in the public cloud is taking unnecessary risks with its outdated security strategies.
In the traditional data center, the network provided a secure boundary for the organization. The network was carved up into zones and trusts were established within and between zones. Security architectures were established and tools deployed based on this strategy, which largely involved monitoring the traffic flows and enforcing controls where the zones met. But in the cloud, this approach is no longer relevant. Time and again, in breach after breach, headline after headline, the modern attack cycle, particularly in the cloud, starts with identity. Attackers seek access to the identity, then pivot between resources, discovering credentials and other identities that give them more and more access to get what they want.]]></summary>

Neo4J has been around since 2007 and in its current iteration, it is an extremely robust and versatile NoSQL database framework. But, there are limitations to graph databases, namely:
Query optimization options are limited, although this challenge is certainly being addressed in newer versions.
Data partitioning is a tough proposition, so horizontal scaling becomes challenging.
Computationally intensive or costly queries — most real-world graphs are highly dynamic and often generate large volumes of data at a very rapid rate. One challenge here is how to store the historical trace compactly while still enabling efficient execution of point queries and global or neighborhood-centric analysis tasks.
Queries spanning multiple hierarchies can be time-consuming and not suitable for real-time querying.
Design is only as good as implementation and this is where the human element comes in. Not everyone can think in terms of graphs.
But, the Graph Cache implementation does not seek to address only the shortcomings of Graph Databases. Over and above these things, Graph Cache seeks to provide a performant framework to do the following:]]></summary>

Sometime later, I hosted a technology leadership forum at a major insurance company in New York. One of the key discussion points included emerging technologies, and of course, microservices.

"A picture is worth a thousand words." Probably, we have all heard that piece of wisdom before.

Visualizing a tricky issue while explaining the background to a stakeholder, someone from the management, or a teammate helps to pave the way to have a meaningful discussion.

But what comes after you set up the platform, planned the partitioning strategy, storage options, and configured the data durability? Yes! How to stream data in and out of the platform. And this is exactly what I want to discuss today.
The Background
Before we go any further, let’s see what Kafka did to make itself blazing fast? Kafka is optimized for writing the stream data in binary format, which basically logs everything directly to the file system (Sequential I/O) and makes a minimum effort to process what's in the data (Optimize for Zero Copy).  Kafka is super-charged at making sure data is stored as quickly as possible, and quickly replicating for a large number of consumers. But terrible at communication, the client that pushes content needs to SPEAK Kafka.]]></summary>

To do tests on Nebula Graph, we need to frequently deploy it on servers, so we need a tool to improve the efficiency of deployment. The tool needs to meet these major requirements:
 
 
It can allow a non-root account to deploy Nebula Graph so that we can use groups to limit resource usage.
 
 
It can modify the configuration files on the operating machines and then distribute the configurations to the cluster for testing the parameters.
 
 
It can be called by using scripts to ease integrating it to the testing platform or tool later.
 

About tool selection, there are several options. Fabric and Puppet are veterans and Ansible and SaltStack are rising stars.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Evolution of Testing Frameworks
So far, during the development of Nebula Graph, its testing framework has undergone three major changes, as shown in the following figure. In this article, I would like to introduce some experience and lessons that our team has learned from these changes.
For a database product, the importance of testing cannot be overemphasized. Therefore, no matter how the testing framework evolves, it always aims to easily and quickly accumulate test cases to assure stability of Nebula Graph functionalities, not only for developers, but also for its users, including maintenance engineers, documentation engineers, and even non-technical users. To achieve this goal, our testing framework must make codeless programming or no-programming possible for users.]]></summary>

MySQL is an RDBMS platform that stores data in a tabular format in a normalized manner, whereas, MongoDB is a NoSQL database that stores information in a schema-less manner as documents that are grouped under collections. The representation of data is completely different and hence migration of MySQL table data to MongoDB collections might sound like a mammoth task. Fortunately, Python makes it a breeze with its strong connectivity and data handling capabilities.
In this article, I will walk you through the steps required to migrate your MySQL table data to MongoDB collections using a simple Python script. The scripts were developed using Python 3.9.5 on Windows. However, it should work with any Python 3+ version on any platform.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It’s difficult to find a boardroom anywhere in the world where cloud-native transformation isn’t a top-five item on the business agenda. Businesses understand that in order to survive and keep up with their competitors, they need to lean heavily into the cloud and embrace it as part of their digital transformation strategy. According to a recent survey of C-suite executives, almost 90% of organizations now understand that cloud technology is going to be a critical step on their path to success. But are they running before they’ve learned to walk? 
Businesses that run headlong into cloud-native transformations tend to do so with an idealized view of what it is they want to achieve. They invest heavily and devote their most valuable resources to trying to achieve the perfect transformation, pinning all of their future successes on it. However, we all know that true perfection is unobtainable, and in pursuing it so doggedly we often cut corners and miss opportunities along the way. The ‘rush to cloud’ has only been exacerbated by the pandemic, pushing companies to up their investments and accelerate their plans for cloud transformation. But rather than speeding up, some of these businesses might be better off slowing down to figure out where they're going and how to get there.]]></summary>

These tables are predominantly used for displaying information in a tabular format. Rows and columns are the key identifiers of web tables in Selenium. If you’re using tables in Selenium PHP, you can perform several operations on the table, like fetching data from a specific row-column combination, searching for a particular key string in the table, etc. Selenium web automation should be used for automating the operations on the web tables.
A simple yet effective use of web tables can be seen in e-commerce websites where detailed product information is displayed in a tabular format since it offers better readability. The information in the table can either be static or dynamically populated through some scripts.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This article explains creating or setting up a cypress.io end-to-end testing framework from scratch using Typescript. Unlike another tutorial, this explains setting up the Cypress framework using Typescript in a simple and easy way. This article is helpful for whoever wants to set up the Cypress Typescript automation framework for the first time. Also, I know that there are many, migrating from different automation frameworks like Protractor, webdriver.io, etc. this will be helpful for them too.
This Tutorial shows page object model creation as well, however you can use it for any type of framework by skipping those steps.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been furious for the larger parts of a decade - Partially due to how our governments and the industrialised war machine of the "United Slaves of America" has treated Assange, Snowden and Manning, arguably spearheaded by Silicon Valley - But also due to the fact of that the internet I grew up with no longer exists. However, I am ready, bring on the storm!
In the 90s when I started hanging out in USENET forums, the internet was a machine for good. Its atmosphere was a feeling of that everything was possible, and together we could create better democratic tools, resulting in a better world, by simply coming together, and together do our part. If everybody pulled a little bit more than their own weight, we could all enter "paradise on Earth".]]></summary>

Infrastructure disaggregation allows organizations to use computing resources more effectively by enabling scalability and flexibility. Disaggregation involves decoupling data center resources of memory, compute and storage, so that each resource can be scaled and provisioned independently. Disaggregation is already widely adopted in cloud computing platforms, with various clouds offering storage systems that are completely independent of compute instances.
Disaggregated storage is a version of composable disaggregated infrastructure that offers scalable storage by connecting various physical storage devices over a network fabric to form a logical storage pool, in some cases on demand. Disaggregated storage enables the creation of dynamic environments where the compute and storage resources scale elastically based on the application’s workload. Separating storage and compute instances also means that storage can be scaled and managed without interfering with the availability of an application’s services.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As companies collect more and more data about their customers, an increased amount of duplicate information starts appearing in the data as well, causing a lot of confusion among internal teams. Since it would be impossible to manually go through all of the data and delete the duplicates, companies have come up with machine learning solutions that perform such work for them. Today we would like to take a look at some interesting uses of machine learning to catch duplicates in all kinds of environments. Before we dive right in, let’s take a look at how machine learning systems work.
How Do Machine Learning Systems Identify Duplicates?
When a person looks at an image or two strings of data it would be fairly easy for them to determine whether or not the images or strings are duplicates. However, how would you train a machine to spot such duplicates? Perhaps a good starting point would be to identify all of the similarities, but then you would need to explain exactly what 'similar' means. Are there gradations to similarities? In order to overcome such challenges, researchers use string metrics to train machine learning models.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’ve worked on websites for several years, both professionally and for side projects. One day, I reflected on the fact that all of my web development education had come from actually making websites. In most cases, I’d have a specific problem, Google how to solve it and learn something new in the process.
I wondered what I was missing by never learning HTML in a comprehensive way. Forget CSS and JavaScript. I’m just talking about raw HTML. It might seem silly to go back to such a basic aspect of web development after a decent amount of experience, but it’s easy to become overconfident with a skill just because you know enough to do a few useful things.]]></summary>

This blog discusses the importance of hybrid multicloud to accelerate business transformation. 
The discussion assumes that the readers are well versed with cloud technology concepts as well as the business value and challenges related to modernizing applications using cloud technologies.
This blog focuses only on the concept of multicloud, which adds new dimensions of complexity and value as opposed to leveraging a single cloud provider.
Evolution of Hybrid Multicloud
The evolution of cloud computing started with the utility computing concept. It began from the concept of dedicated resources vs. shared resource platforms. Businesses have embraced cloud platforms including private, public, hybrid, and hybrid multicloud.
In a simple term, a hybrid multicloud is the use of hybrid cloud and multicloud models as depicted in diagram 1.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[API Observability is a key component to properly execute APIOps Cycles and ensure your building something of value for your API users. If you’re not familiar with APIOps Cycles, take a look at this guide which provides an agile framework to quickly build APIs that are business-oriented and serve customer needs. API Observability itself is an evolution of traditional monitoring and born out of control systems theory.
Traditional monitoring focuses on tracking known unknowns. This means you already know what to measure like Request Per Second or Errors Per Second. While the metric value may be unknown beforehand, you already know what to measure or probe such as a counter to track requests into buckets. This makes it possible to report on the health of a system (like Red, Yellow, Green), but is a bad tool for troubleshooting engineering or business issues which usually require asking arbitrary questions.]]></summary>

Recently I had to integrate with Google Maps API for a job-related task. I had a great experience working with Google Maps API both on the backend and frontend, but it was not without problems and a lot of research. In fact, I did learn a lot and for this very reason, I decided to share some of the most interesting pitfalls that I fell in.
To show you what I learned I assembled a small no-brainer application. It is a Spring Boot/Thymeleaf web application with the mission to display on a map the employees from an organization. It can display a particular employee on the map, all the employees on the map, and during the creation of an employee, it allows picking an address from a pinpoint on a map. The features that I decided to implement are for the sake of tutorial purposes and they may not make a lot of sense sometimes. The app can be found here: employee-locator]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Backward compatibility 
Backward compatibility is a property of a system, product, or technology that allows for integration with an older legacy system or with an input designed for such a system. Modifying a system in a way that does not allow backward compatibility is called “Breaking Change.” While in the current era of agile software development demands fast-paced implementation of features to cater to rapidly changing requirements, it is extremely necessary to have backward compatibility in the software being developed.
This article depicts with an example how Java has achieved backward compatibility while developing new features, which will serve as a potential reference while updating existing code.
Let us understand the very important concept of 'widening' and how it is retained while developing new features like 'Autoboxing' in Java 5
Widening
In a class that has overloaded methods, one of the compiler's jobs is to determine which method to use whenever it finds an invocation for the overloaded method.]]></summary>

However, by leveraging Open Source intelligently, you can significantly reduce this cost, by literally having the entirety of GitHub's user base, working for "free" for your company. This of course is a bit like what investors refers to as "China math", but GitHub has 65 million registered user accounts, most of whom we must assume are developers one way or another. If you intelligently structure your organisation around GitHub, there is literally nothing preventing you from using every single one of these developers as your own company's resource, making you a million times more productive than mega corporations such as Amazon, Facebook, and Microsoft - For a millionth of the cost these mega corporations are paying. But first let's illustrate the problem, such that the solution becomes clear ...
The problem
In one of my previous jobs somebody had cloned an open source git repository, then added its code to our own private corporate cloud's git repositories, for then to start modifying the thing (the horror!) 2 years later it took one of my developers 6 weeks to update the thing to use the latest version as created by its main developer on GitHub, trying to keep as many of our own customisations as possible in the process. Needless to say, but I was furious about the original decision, due to having responsibilities for code quality at this company.]]></summary>

But things get even more interesting when you start looking at how our various APIs can work together to enable more powerful workflows. In this blog post, I’m going to demonstrate a simple example of that using Adobe Document Generation and PDF Services API together.
Our Demo Scenario
Every month, our company needs to send out invoices. Each invoice goes to a unique company and consists of a series of line items and a total. As these invoices sometimes include sensitive information, we want to protect the document with a unique password so that only the recipient can open it. Altogether this sounds like a somewhat complex process, but let's break it down step by step.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In most organizations, developers are not allowed to access the production environment for stability, security, or regulatory reasons. This is a quite good practice (enforced by many frameworks like COBIT or ITIL) to restrict access to production but a major drawback is a mental distance created between developers and the real world. Likewise, the monitoring is usually only managed by operators and very little feedback is provided to developers except when they have to fix application bugs (ASAP, of course). As a matter of fact, most developers have very little idea of what a real production environment looks like and, more important, of the non-functional requirements allowing to write production-proof code.
Involving developers into resolving production issues is a good thing for two main reasons:]]></summary>

It is increasingly being used for new purposes, including device security since it can detect and stop threats. Although artificial intelligence is used for cybersecurity threat detection and mitigation, it also poses a risk as hackers utilize it as well.
This trend is rapidly gaining momentum and is part of the reason ransomware attacks increased 150% last year. DevOps developers working on new cybersecurity algorithms must learn to reverse engineer the applications hackers develop with AI to create more robust defenses. Malware has become very sophisticated due to advances in artificial intelligence, making it more complex for users and companies to detect or prevent.]]></summary>

1. Introduction
Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) is one of the most popular AWS services. It allows you to create cloud computing instances in no time. You have the choice out of predefined templates (AMI) for several Operating Systems. Pricing is dependent on what kind of purpose the instance needs to serve. Whether you want to have an instance continuously running, or only at a scheduled interval, or you need bare metal, or a dedicated instance, etc. Many options are available for different purposes. Besides that, a lot of different configurations are available to choose from. You will need to choose the right one for your application. In the Free Tier, you only use the micro instance. All of this information is available at the Amazon website and therefore only links to these pages are provided. The offerings may change and you should refer to the Amazon website for the details.]]></summary>

Generally, what one database administrator considers to be a "good" database design might not seem so perfect for another DBA. Everyone has their own set of preferences—depending on experience and other things—but in general, even while MySQL does move forward at a rapid pace, with improvements being made left and right, MySQL schema design practices do not change much.]]></summary>

First, there is the kid who does everything by the book and does well in school. Second, is the character that builds a business by testing the limits and getting the job done while still coloring in the lines. Third, the wild child character throws all of the pieces of a problem in the air to see how and where they will land.
When it comes to project management, there are three main types, just like the characters mentioned earlier. Waterfall is the cautious and rule-abiding kid. Agile is the businessman testing the speed limits to get a product out quickly. Finally, cowboy is the rule-breaker who just wants to get the job done without overthinking the rules they may be breaking.]]></summary>

It Has a Meaningful Name
Functions should have names that describes their purpose or functionality. When a function has a meaningful name, it's easy to read and understand its purpose.
For example, if a function's purpose is to find a customer by ID, a good name could be findCustomerById(id: String). It could also just as well be findCustomer(id: String) because the function signature implies that the customer is found by their ID. The word find also implies that the customer might be found or it might not be found.
If the function's name would be changed to getCustomer(id: String), its meaning changes because now it implies that there's no fallback; the customer is either found or the function fails miserably and maybe throws an exception.
Both are valid names for a function but they have a different meaning and therefore their implementations should also be different.]]></summary>

However, once the model is in place, several frameworks are available to generate the request or the command. Which choices are the most relevant? Let's explore.
Criteria JPA2
Once your dependencies are added, the Criteria API is immediately available. It is the most basic and requires knowing the API and its subtleties to produce requests. The use of these objects obliges to pass directly in character string the name of the attributes in order to impose restrictions. Errors are therefore quite frequent during development and during refactoring operations. Plus, because these errors happen at run time, they are often caught too late.]]></summary>

So what should you do next to make your serverless functions fit better with the many choices available to you?]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[App development stacks have been improving so rapidly and effectively that today there are a number of easy, straightforward paths to push code to production, on the cloud platform of your choice. But what use are applications without the data that users interact with? Persistent data is such an indispensable piece of the IT puzzle that it’s perhaps the reason the other pieces even exist. 
Enter cloud and internet scale requirements, essentially mandating that back-end services must be independently scalable / modular subsystems to succeed. Traditionally, this requirement has been difficult in the extreme for stateful systems. No doubt, database as-a-service (DBaaS) has made provisioning, operations, and security easier. But as anyone who has tried to run databases on Kubernetes will tell you: auto scaling databases, especially ones that are easy for developers to use, remain out of reach for mere mortals.]]></summary>

Now, we can check easily in a live environment, determine if some particular index will be helpful or not, and figure out how we get to know which index to test. This requires an in-depth knowledge of indexing and, also, experience in Postgresql. But, in PostgreSQL, we can get an automatic recommendation of indexes for specific queries by using three extensions hypog, pg_stat_statements, and pg_qualstats. 
Now, let’s move directly to the practical part of how we can use this feature in Postgres.]]></summary>

Should you happen to be researching "Service-Oriented Architecture" (SOA) on the Internet today, the latest articles you are likely to find will typically be titled: "SOA vs microservices". Complicating the battle somewhat is that you will also find respected industry experts, such as Martin Fowler, stating that some “consider microservices to be one form of SOA, perhaps service orientation done right”.
Martin goes on to declare: “The problem…is that SOA means too many different things and that most of the time we come across something called 'SOA' [there is]…a focus on ESBs (Enterprise Service Buses) used to integrate monolithic applications. This common manifestation of SOA has led some microservice advocates to reject the SOA label entirely”. As such, for the remainder of this article, I will assume the use of ESB middleware as a fundamental characteristic of SOA landscapes, as well as representing the most fundamental distinction there is between SOA and REST.]]></summary>

On the other hand exists a human being led by complex emotions and hormones that are triggered by chemical reactions in the brain. These two don’t seem like a match, do they? However, when it comes to creating a hybrid of the two, the two seemingly contradictory concepts — psychology and artificial intelligence — complement each other perfectly.

Artificial Intelligence, or AI, refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think like humans and mimic their actions.

Motivation
This scenario came out of a real-world situation where I got paged in the early hours of the day by a contractor evaluating our product on behalf of a customer. The contractor was in panic and concerned that she'd just lost four days worth of work by executing an older version of her application which included a hardcoded TRUNCATE statement. There was no backup available either. We were faced with a situation where we were going to miss customer timeline and lose the precious time reloading the data. We are talking about a multi-TB dataset. Once I had some coffee and we huddled to disucss next steps, we agreed the best next option is to leverage CockroachDB capability where dropped data does not leave the filesystem until garbage collection is complete, which by default is set to 25hours and luckily for us, that property was not changed in the cluster. Needless to say, we were able to recover the lost data following the procedure below.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In most cases, you aren’t the only person working on the same project or codebase. That means that other people get to read your code and have to understand it. That’s also true for the code comments you leave behind. Developers often write ‘quick and dirty’ comments without much context, leaving other developers clueless about what you’re trying to say. It’s a bad practice that creates only more confusion than clarifies things.
So, yes - you should be bothered with writing meaningful code comments to help other developers. A code comment that describes the function, the reasoning behind the function, and its input and output will speed up the learning process of other developers. Especially for junior developers, this information comes in handy when learning the code.]]></summary>

We put out a call out for real-world experiences of what helps when it comes to reducing technical debt and received a huge number of responses from devs across a variety of sectors. In the previous article, developers told us about their technical debt horror stories. Here’s what they had to say about how to manage and prevent it:

For example, says Devadas, insurance companies use hyperautomation to process numerous documents to settle claims. Because of hyperautomation, he says, artificial intelligence (AI)-powered tools can read and extract data at super-human speed from documents, chat, and other channels.  Which allows claims to be processed faster and more accurately than ever before.]]></summary>

It always surprises me how organizations and teams just start on it without proper readiness and planning. And then they fail! Miserably and the team, QA engineers, or some such entity is to blame. Frustrating to say the least. In-sprint automation is doable but not always possible in all teams. If not planned and executed correctly this goal can quickly become a distant dream.
As the name suggests, in-sprint automation is automating and developing the user story in the same sprint. Easier said than done. The team will need to overcome several challenges before getting to this state.]]></summary>

Terraform’s adoption since its mid-2014 release to the software development landscape has been meteoric. More than 8000 organizations are using Terraform for infrastructure automation.
To successfully use the IAC tool, it’s important to optimize HashiCorp Configuration Language (HCL). HCL has become one of the most popular languages on GitHub. Typically though, it’s preferable to work with a familiar programming language rather than learning a new one. The good news here is that the Terraform community, in collaboration with AWS Cloud Development Kit (CDK), recently announced the support of TypeScript and Python for provisioning infrastructure using Terraform. Developers can leverage these languages to optimize the IaC’s tools for many providers and modules.]]></summary>

The query optimization problem is NP-hard, and the number of possible plans grows exponentially with the query’s complexity.

Observability is the quality of software, services, platforms, or products that allows us to understand how systems are behaving. Without the new sources of data giving us insights, our modern cloud-native applications would be quite a challenge to monitor. Observability, that deep data, is the new fuel for our developer and DevOps engineers.
The duality of observability is controllability. Observability is the ability to infer the internal state of a 'machine' from externally exposed signals. Controllability is the ability to control input to direct the internal state to the desired outcome. While driving, observing a red stoplight means controlling our vehicle by pressing the breaks (or in some modern vehicles, having the brakes applied automatically for us).]]></summary>

As software development marches towards the cloud, we soon realize that this shift warrants the need to rethink our debugging strategies. This is because as software systems are now leveraging these advancements in cloud computing and distributed systems we see gaps emerging in debugging that cannot be satisfied by the traditional methods of logging and breakpoints.
For example, a major issue while using breakpoints is that the codebase needs to be run in debug mode. Therefore, we are not actually replicating the actual state of our systems taking into consideration multi-threading, distributed services, and dependencies on remote services in a cloud-native environment along with multi-service architecture. Similarly, logs offer no respite, as they may be cumbersome and even costly to execute and store.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This article will explain why optimization is so important as we explore some of the best ways to quickly optimize your SQL queries for minimum impact on database performance through:
 
Efficient indexing,
SELECT and SELECT DISTINCT statement refinement,
Strategic use of wildcards and conditionals, and
Query cost analysis using EXPLAIN
Introduction to SQL Query and Data Management
Standard Query Language, or SQL for short, allows users access to databases using specific commands or queries, allowing them to change and maintain them. Commands such as SELECT — which helps users extract the data from the database — UPDATE, DELETE, INSERT INTO, and many more, make data management easier for database administrators.
Each of these commands has its own set of functionalities that are useful when working with databases. A few SQL IDEs, such as Arctype, offer developers the ideal framework for visualizing, designing, modeling, and managing their databases. Arctype is a free, collaborative, and intuitive SQL editor to simplify all your data management and visualization requirements.]]></summary>

Just like monitoring our applications, it is very much necessary to monitor our database system. We want to monitor things substantially more granular than system-level processes — things such as:
How many queries actually make use of the index?
How effective is the database cache?
The number of open connections.
And so on.]]></summary>

I highly recommend that you also read a post from my colleague Fernando from a few months ago about the CKAD exam, which goes into much more detail about the aspects of these exams and helps you to pass them. I got some essential tips from reading his post!
Previous Experiences with Kubernetes
In all honesty, exactly a year ago I knew nothing about Kubernetes - it wasn't because I had never worked with it, but that I wasn't even clear about the concept of "container". It's true that this last year I've been working with this tool frequently (which undoubtedly helped me when preparing for the exam), but I think you need no more than a little previous experience.]]></summary>

Optimist storms out of this phase to believe that it’s only a rough patch, while the pessimist spirals into hopelessness with the belief in the permanent nature of their situation.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Before OOP languages, the programmer would control how the program is executed and that would be from the app’s main routine. In modern programming, that control is delegated to the external non-main loops, and the main routine becomes an event-loop that waits for events to occur and then executes it with the relevant event handler.
This new model of programming (it has been around since the 70s though) is called event-driven programming.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In our technology-driven world, electronic communication is increasingly overshadowing verbal communication. Whether we are filling out an online form, sending a text on our phone, or writing an email, it is a fact that many of our business and personal interactions require efficiently written (typed) language. Due to this heavy reliance on electronic communication, it is critical to ensure your online platform has a support system built-in to account for human error; if your application or website allows input or search queries from users, you run the risk of your systems not understanding the text due to spelling errors — and this is where spellcheck comes in.
When you stop and consider how many times you encounter spellcheck in your electronic interactions, it should become clear that it has created a huge failsafe for our often rushed and impatient natures. Spellcheck has come a long way since its beginnings; the first spellcheckers simply verified words instead of suggesting corrections. Fast forward to our current era and spellcheckers have improved in both functionality and efficiency; they operate in the background of our applications and let us know with a red line that we have made a potential error. This is often accomplished with Natural Language Processing (NLP) which, as we have discussed previously, enables computers to process and interpret human language in the form of text or audio data.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Motivation
CockroachDB is a cloud-native SQL database for building global, scalable cloud services that survive disasters. It makes building geo-distributed databases easy. Ability to anchor data to geographic localities is a unique capability of CockroachDB. Today, I will demonstrate this ability to extend beyond regions, availability zones, nodes, data centers and racks. The architecture allows us to domicile data to specific storage devices using storage attributes.
High-Level Steps
Start a CockroachDB cluster with multiple disks per node using storage attributes
Create a table pinned to a specific disk type
Create another table and verify its location on disk
Evict the second table to demonstrate granularity
Assign proper storage constraints deterministically
Verify Setup
Step by Step Instructions

It also allows network administrators control over what online content can be viewed by network users. Therefore, as well as keeping networks and the devices that link to them safe from viruses, a web filtering appliance can also help enhance productivity in the workplace.
Every time a network user visits a link or enters a URL into a browser bar, the web filtering appliance compares the request to open a web page against blacklists of websites and IP addresses.

For this first-of-its-kind report, Tricentis interviewed quality leaders at one hundred Fortune 500 (or global equivalent) organizations and major government agencies across the Americas, Europe, and Asia-Pacific.
Although there is no shortage of reports on overall software testing trends, the state of testing at the organizational level—particularly at “household name” brands—has historically been a black box. On the one hand, large organizations often have access to resources far beyond the reach of smaller businesses (for example, commercial as well as open-source software, access to consultants and services, etc.).

Technology is ever-evolving, and we have seen a major shift in application platforms from on-premise to cloud and containerization, application architecture from monolithic to micro-service, and many more. Organizations today are working towards making the operations an easy task and reducing the cost, as it is one of the painful areas where the project spends a lot of time and effort to streamline the entire process. Jenkins X is one of the platforms which has such kind of capability.
For an individual who is into technology, the familiarity of the name Jenkins is not uncommon. But "What is Jenkins X?" and once we will know about it, certainly, there will be more questions in our mind, and most of them will be answered in this essential document.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Every time I travel to Japan, something that strikes me is how process-driven the Japanese people and culture seem to be. Even something as simple as buying a train ticket is an intricately refined process. The ticket seller first makes sure they have heard and understood you correctly, repeating back your exact request before they print the tickets. And once they’re printed out, they will pick up a pen and check each detail of the ticket — before going through each check again with you. You will be given exact and clear instructions on how to locate the platform and when to expect the train. And you’ll notice that when the train arrives and stops at the platform, the driver also has a checklist they will diligently follow. It’s incredible to observe, but not arbitrary — they do this because they have found it reduces error rates by up to 85% and ensures everything runs smoothly.
You might be wondering what Japan has to do with successfully coaching teams, particularly within an Agile framework. And the answer is Shu Ha Ri. This Japanese concept, roughly translated to “first learn, then detach, and finally, transcend” (or more simply: walk, run, fly) is a way of thinking about the stages of learning from beginner to master — and a key philosophy used in the martial art Aikido. Working in an Agile way requires much learning of new rituals, processes, and different ways of thinking, so if you are a scrum master, this concept can be a very useful one for understanding and guiding you in how to be a better team coach and ensuring that each project runs just as smoothly (and to time) as a bullet train.]]></summary>

The answer to their problem is APIs. Who builds those APIs? Are they built quickly or are the frontend developers left waiting? Who runs and manages the APIs? After all, the backends do not behave in uniform ways — they speak different languages, emit differently shaped data, have varying authentication requirements, and so on. So running and managing the frontend APIs is not a task to be taken lightly.
Here are some considerations as you think through the APIs that are the gearbox between the frontend and backends.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nic Raboy remembers the challenge of database management from his experience at a previous employer that ultimately led him to a career as Senior Developer Advocate at MongoDB. "Every time we had to scale, which was about once a year, we had to throw more money at servers to make them more powerful. Not only that, but you had to actually shut down the database to scale it up. We'd have to worry about backups and making sure that things don't go south during the process."
MongoDB helps solve many of the pain points of database management by delivering a distributed database platform built for the cloud era. Millions of developers around the world use MongoDB to power companies with massive troves of data to manage, such as Google, SAP, eBay, Sega and EA.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Introduction
We’ve all been there when we have to manually redline our designs so developers know exactly what our perfect designs are actually showing; we have even tried sending over source files for our devs to use when implementing. But isn’t there a better way of sending over detailed design information? 
There are ways we can make markups easier and a way of disseminating this information quicker and more efficiently. This is of the utmost importance; if a developer doesn’t have all the information in front of them they will not spend precious time digging around for important information, a good handoff is a detailed project with information to hand or directly on top of the designs for quick implementation.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As awesome as flexbox is, what it’s doing under the hood is actually a little strange because, by default, it is doing two things at once. It first looks at the content size which is what we would get if by declaring width: max-content on an element. But on top of that, flex-shrink is also doing some work allowing the items to be smaller, but only if needed.
Let’s break those two down and see how they work together.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[What is SAML 2.0?
At its core, Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) 2.0 is a means to exchange authorization and authentication information between services. SAML is frequently used to implement internal corporate single sign-on (SSO) solutions where the user logs into a service that acts as the single source of identity which then grants access to a subset of other internal services.
The advantage of adopting SAML/SSO from a security perspective is clear:]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A faster startup and smaller memory footprint always matter in Kubernetes due to the expense of running thousands of application pods and the cost savings of doing it with fewer worker nodes and other resources. Memory is more important than throughput on containerized microservices on Kubernetes because:
It's more expensive due to permanence (unlike CPU cycles)
Microservices multiply the overhead cost
One monolith application becomes N microservices (e.g., 20 microservices ≈ 20GB)
This significantly impacts serverless function development and the Java deployment model. This is because many enterprise developers chose alternatives such as Go, Python, and Nodejs to overcome the performance bottleneck—until now, thanks to Quarkus, a new Kubernetes-native Java stack. This article explains how to optimize Java performance to run serverless functions on Kubernetes using Quarkus.]]></summary>

This year a number of financial services firms have had to comply with a new "401(k)-to-IRA Rollover Advice" fiduciary rule. This rule mandates that wealth managers and broker-dealers must demonstrate "investor's best interest" intent when presenting investment opportunities to their clients.
Many financial services firms with legacy and 3rd party SaaS application landscape face a common challenge of data lineage and data consistency throughout the client onboarding user journey.

A developer-friendly approach to do so if you work in the Java ecosystem is to package DTOs and endpoint interfaces in an API jar file and use the Retrofit framework to create type-safe clients for integration testing. This article discusses a complete example.
If you’ve worked in enterprise Java projects you will remember good old Web Services Description Language, the XML based format for describing network services by IBM and Microsoft. Maybe you still work with it? WSDL and its twin XML Schema are among those W3C standards that seasoned developers love to hate. Its specification files are not very human readable, let alone human writable. Fortunately you don't have to. They can be generated by your server endpoint and fed straight into a code generator to create transfer objects (DTOs) and service stubs.]]></summary>

I left Microsoft after 19 years, where I led teams that built system software for highly scalable cloud applications. This included leading development of the Microsoft Orleans framework from its inception at Microsoft Research until it became one of the most successful open-source projects within the .NET ecosystem. Orleans powers a number of large-scale Microsoft systems such as Xbox Game Services, Skype, Azure IoT, Azure ML, Azure Active Directory, and many more cloud services outside Microsoft. So if you’ve ever played online multiplayer games like Halo or Call of Duty, our team built much of the underlying infrastructure that supports it.
When I originally joined Orleans, cloud computing was still in its infancy. We had a 10,000-foot vision and not a single line of actual code. We needed to reimagine how cloud-scale applications should be coded because, at the time, available and high-performance scalable systems were only achievable by experts. And while everyone knew the cloud was coming, we had no idea how to build applications in a way that ensured they would be accessible and productive for millions of software engineers.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Assuming you're working in an environment where you have to communicate and collaborate with others, avoiding micro management starts out with the architecture of whatever you want to build. I was once asked how I would go ahead of leading a software development department, and my answer was; "Well, first of all, I consider everybody to be a lead developer one way or another."
The above is a crucial mindset to facilitate for autonomy. Simply because as developers, our primary objective is often to become better, and as a manager I perceive my primary task to facilitate for that, within an environment where arguably the company's primary objectives, are solved almost as a "side effect" of the individual team members' personal objectives are being solved. By aligning the company's incentives with the individuals' incentives, your team members will be able to deliver 100 times more than if these are in opposition with each other. After a while, it becomes like "gravity". Self sustained software development departments, with such momentum, that for the uninitiated it seems to be like a force of nature, you couldn't stop even if you tried!]]></summary>

The basic idea is to make it easier for a person to share or bookmark the current state of an application. Let's start with a basic example.
There's a list of items which consist of people, cats, and a dog. Each item has a name and type. On top there are filters for the name and type. If you enter any text, the items that match the name (ignoring case) will be shown. If you select one or more of the types, only those matching will be shown.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In this post, I’m going to show you how to set up and run your very own private, dedicated Minecraft server in the cloud. I have blogged about this before, but the server was limited to 1 CPU core and 1 GB of RAM in that post. In this post, we're going to create a server with up to 4 CPU cores and 24 GB of RAM! That’s more than enough resources to host a game with 20+ friends with excellent performance (and still have enough leftover to create another server for something else). And best of all, it’s absolutely free! Forever!! I’m sure you’re just as excited as I am about this, so let’s jump right into it and get started!
Why Is This a Big Deal? 
In this post, we’re going to launch a new OCI Virtual Machine that uses a new Ampere Arm chip. These VMs provide better price-performance and near-linear scaling for CPU-bound workloads compared to x86-based instances. They are suitable for a wide range of workloads including web applications, media encoding, AI Inferencing, and much more. We’re very proud that Oracle is now partnering with leading technology vendors to make Arm server-side development first-class and easy.]]></summary>

Minimum Viable Feedback (MVF)
We have all seen projects that didn’t have the right user validation and feedback. We know this information is important, but getting it, and using it effectively, can be difficult. This can be especially problematic with new projects where you can get into that tricky phase of being slightly ahead of where the users are. It may be tempting to wait to proceed based on user feedback, but that leads to a “chicken or egg” scenario. The faster you can provide meaningful improvements, the greater the adoption, which means greater feedback.]]></summary>

In the previous post of this series "AWS Application Deployment Basics," we set up a PostgreSQL database and then we connect to it via a NodeJS application.
However, the Nodejs application is running on the same machine and database access is local for it. It is a totally valid setup and because it is on the same machine, the access is straightforward. But, having applications and databases running on separate machines is also a very common setup and we will cover that path as well later in this series. But today, we will focus mostly on the web server we want to run on an EC2 instance in the public subnet.]]></summary>

Software Architecture Culture
The culture is better and the results are much better in teams where software developers and architects pay particular attention to software architecture quality. In teams where it’s all about delivering tickets as quickly as possible, the culture and results are poorer. It is proven! However, it is very important to highlight that where there is too much focus on software architecture and not enough on delivery is hugely counter-productive as well.

I’m not going to sugarcoat it; the security industry has fallen way behind the broader tech industry in the last decade in a really fundamental way. While much of the tech industry has started to pivot away from hardware and software-based solutions – which dominated the 90s and early 2000s – and towards the use of API-first SaaS services, most of the security industry has not.
Now, this reluctance to embrace a new way of delivering security outcomes means that customers are overburdened with acquiring, deploying, and managing security tools in a legacy model. A painful, not to mention expensive, way to defend against threats.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[SAFe and Business Architecture. As organizations begin their Lean and Agile journey with SAFe®, SPCs will introduce a tool designed to help organizations determine the best, most logical place to launch their first Agile Release Train (ART). The Value Stream and ART Identification Workshop is designed to help organizations identify the sweet spot where an opportunity to deliver value intersects with a clear problem to solve, leadership support, a clear product or solution, and collaborating teams.
It’s challenging to meet the criteria mentioned above, which is why many are tempted to launch ARTs within easier-to-identify constructs such as organizational silos. This rarely works. As we know, value often does not follow the organizational hierarchy. However, it’s important to understand that value stream identification is the first step in an ongoing practice of flow management to optimize the speed of delivery, quality, and customer delight.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For a long time software development processes have been using packages. A package, for all intents and purposes, is a container file. Much like a zip file, they contain other files such as binaries, source code, scripts, and also a manifest that tells users what this project package means. Some common usages of packages are to make it easier to reuse and share code or to deploy code dependencies to different projects. Often, having a formal system with packages can help expose bugs sooner, making it easier to deliver trustworthy software. FlexDeploy packages, along with other built-in continuous integration and delivery functionality, will allow for a significant increase in productivity for developers and release managers.
In this blog, we will explore the significance of partial projects, how we can utilize project packages, and also integrating change management into the build and deployment of those packages.]]></summary>

Artificial intelligence (AI) is set to transform global productivity, working patterns, and lifestyles and create enormous wealth. Research firm Gartner expects the global AI economy to increase from about $1.2 trillion last year to about $3.9 Trillion by 2022, while McKinsey sees it delivering global economic activity of around $13 trillion by 2030. And of course, this transformation is fueled by the powerful Machine Learning (ML) tools and techniques such as Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL), Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN), Gradient-boosted-tree models (GBM), Natural Language Processing (NLP), and more.
Most of the success in modern AI and ML systems is dependent on their ability to process massive amounts of raw data in a parallel fashion using task-optimized hardware. In fact, the modern resurgence of AI started with the 2012 ImageNet competition where deep-learning algorithms demonstrated an eye-popping increment in the image classification accuracy over their non-deep-learning counterparts (algorithms). However, along with clever programming and mathematical modeling, the use of specialized hardware played a significant role in this early success.]]></summary>

All those tutorials do a very good job in helping the developers to get started using gRPC in their projects. We can find materials talking about gRPC server, stub client, interceptors, protobuf, encrypted connection, load balancing but hardly we find all this together and prepared for a real production scenario. Deployments to production are not discussed and available resources are sparse.
There are some projects that provide a collection of handy features that can help you to set up gRPC communication in a reliable way but they are all generic building blocks without an initial structure that you can evolve from.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One of the most impactful ways to reduce spend on Kubernetes infrastructure is to make sure your clusters are optimally sized for the workloads they run. Working with many teams over the past year we have seen that it’s not so obvious how to arrive at an optimally-sized cluster, even in autoscaling environments. In response, we are publicly launching a new tool that we’ve used to help teams recently! While implementing this solution with users so far we’ve seen savings in the range of 25-60%, even having a major impact in autoscaling environments.
How It WorksPermalink
This new tool generates context-aware cluster sizing recommendations after analyzing Kubernetes metrics on historical workloads and cloud billing data. As a user, you only need to provide the context of the cluster, i.e. whether it is being used for development, production, or high-availability workloads. We then recommend cluster configurations, which optimize for the respective balance of cost, simplicity, and performance/headroom. Because this solution is Kubernetes native, we consider the following when providing recommendations:]]></summary>

One static, fundamental principle will continue to shape the tech economy and how future businesses will run. This series discusses how the Modularity Principle will force all of us to find a specialty and perfect its network API.
Complex Systems
All systems are simply a sum of their parts. When I see someone look at a monstrous problem and become flustered, they’re usually flustered because they don’t even know where to begin. Other times, they know where to start, but they balk at the amount of time they perceive it takes to solve the problem. This balking is a valid defense mechanism that prevents us from wasting our time on things that do not matter to us.]]></summary>

Git Flow is an abstract idea of a Git workflow. It helps with continuous software development and implementing DevOps practices. The Git Flow Workflow defines a strict branching model designed around the project release. This provides a robust framework for managing larger projects.  
Git Flow is ideally suited for projects that have a scheduled release cycle and for the DevOps best practice of continuous delivery. It assigns very specific roles to different branches and defines how and when they should interact. It uses individual branches for preparing, maintaining, and recording releases.]]></summary>

Although functions based on virtual machine architecture in the 1.0 phase made this paradigm very popular, as the graphic below shows, there were limits around execution time, protocols, and poor local-development experience.
Developers then realized that they could apply the same serverless traits and benefits to microservices and Linux containers. This launched the 1.5 phase, where some serverless containers completely abstracted Kubernetes, delivering the serverless experience through Knative or another abstraction layer that sits on top of it.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When building applications and programs for use by other developers, ensuring you are utilizing valid code identifiers is an important component. These unique identifiers are symbols that have been designated to specific program elements essential to the successful creation of a program, and they can refer to a wide variety of features, including class, namespace, types, variables, and more. To avoid any confusion or misinterpretation, the names given to the symbols should clearly indicate the usage of the corresponding element. The general idea is to create an identity of sorts for the symbol so that it can easily be identified by any individual, not just the original developer.
During the creation of these integral program pieces, it is also important to be conscious of the technical nuances of the applicable programming language; for example, since Java is case sensitive, identifiers that have different cases will be treated differently. As you may know, attempting to navigate the various rules and requirements for code identifiers can take up a lot of time, so we are going to highlight an easy tool you can integrate to do the work for you. The following API can be run in Java to validate input identifiers and analyze for incorrect strokes including usage of whitespace, hyphens, underscores, and other special symbols within the identifier. This is accomplished by configuring input rules for the symbols, such as allowing the identifier “helloWorld” but not "hello*World".]]></summary>

1. What Is Automation?
Automation is the key to improving efficiency, reducing human error and reducing operating costs. Repetitive work will require fewer workers, and more employees will focus on strategic decision-making and creative problem solving.

2. The 2 Types of Automation Technology
Robotic Process Automation (RPA)
Business process automation (often referred to as business process management or BPM)
In general, low-code automation capabilities can more prompt companies that rely on repetitive processes to evaluate how to improve efficiency. They will need to retrain and redistribute employees to assume roles that can leverage their experience and institutional knowledge with strategic capabilities.]]></summary>

DZone Dev of the Month - Mir Ali

From DZone Editor Samantha Ross: "Mir Ali (DZone profile) never fails to bring the fire and wisdom to his beautifully worded articles. His focus this May was on Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC), but since he started only this past December, he's shared his knowledge on everything from AI to DevOps. Both his published pieces this month I classed as phenomenally well-written, and I'd like to congratulate Mir on his growing DZone portfolio and engagement, having hit his 100k this month. Looking forward to what's next!"]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I often help people automate the configuration of their infrastructure so they can build 3-node clusters that span Availability Zones and Regions. The CLI for creating a DataKeeper Job and associated mirrors that contain more than one target can be a little confusing, so I'm documenting it here in case you find yourself looking for this information. The DataKeeper documentation describes this as a Mirror with Multiple Targets.
The environment in this example looks like this:
PRIMARY (10.0.2.100) - in AZ1
SECONDARY (10.0.3.100) - in AZ2
DR (10.0.1.10) - in a different Region
I want to create a synchronous mirror from PRIMARY to SECONDARY and an asynchronous mirror from PRIMARY to DR. I also have to make sure the DataKeeper Job knows how to create a mirror from SECONDARY to DR in case the SECONDARY or DR server ever become the source of the mirror. EMCMD will be used to create this multiple target mirror.
We need to first create the Job that contains all this possible endpoints and define whether the mirror will be Sync (S) or Async (A) between those endpoints.]]></summary>

Continuous integration (CI) and feature flags look like a match made in heaven. Integrating code regularly, combined with the ability to isolate new features and turn them on and off at will, means you can move fast and still manage risk.
But with great power comes great responsibility. Feature flags require careful planning and continuous management, just like your builds do.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For quite a while now, developers have used snippets of code to turn features on and off during runtime. These code snippets, more commonly known as feature flags, allow you to change features (or sub-sections) of your application without re-deploying. They help developers release code faster, with less risk. 
Feature flags are more prevalent than you might believe. At most companies, though, adoption begins at the grassroots level. Developers—usually within a single team, and often just a few individuals—implement a handful of feature flags in an ad hoc way. In these early stages, feature flags aren’t usually being considered at a systemic level. They’re meant to solve specific pain points at specific points in time. There is no formal program in place, and there are no plans to manage flags across teams.]]></summary>

Regex, or a more known terminology, Regular Expressions, is used to create complex patterns for searching substring inside Strings.
We have other methods of finding substring as well, but regex can cope up with way more complicated patterns than just normal searching for a substring.]]></summary>

Companies typically avoid providing details on their data breaches. Today we have a rare exception. The staff of the Russian opposition leader, Alexey Navalny, has posted a detailed report on both the breach they had earlier this year and their investigation into the breach.

Alright, let's face it—there is a lot of content talking about how REST vs messaging APIs and how one is more fir than the other for a microservices architecture design. I wrote a blog post about My journey to learning EDA that highlights what event-driven architecture is. Whether you are new to event-driven architecture (EDA) or have some background with it via dabbling with gRPC, kafka, rabbitMQ, Solace, or whatever messaging API, I am here to share with you 5 claims about EDA that I will be busting or confirming. 
 
 
I Will Have to Re-Design My Rest-Heavy Architecture From Scratch To Adopt EDA
 

MYTH
Advanced event brokers allow for protocol translation within the broker. What does this mean you might ask? Well, it is very common in any software architecture design approach to have a polyglot of protocols and APIs in an application. Whether you are using REST, or different messaging protocols (MQTT, AMQP, Solace, Kafka...etc) you would want your different microservices to communicate with each other.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the reading of Natural Language Processing (NLP) applications, we inevitably encounter two main features in action, Categorization and Extraction, and learn how those can be manipulated in so many different ways to effectively address use cases that involve free-form text and the retrieval of information from it. We also hear a lot about Sentiment (which technically is not a separate feature but rather a specialization of the previous two). Finally, we have POS-tagging, which is only occasionally mentioned outside of deeply technical articles for linguists and NLP professionals. 
We don’t hear much about other NLP capabilities, and this is mainly because often, depending on how an NLP engine is designed, features beyond Categorization and Extraction are not present at all. Specifically, many NLP solutions today are based on Machine Learning algorithms, and ML rarely delivers great accuracy in problems that require both elevated precision and super-fine identification. Then again, some of these capabilities are incredibly useful, in fact sometimes even the only way to address a particular challenge. In the following, I make the case for one of these not-so-popular NLP tools: SAO (Subject-Action-Object).]]></summary>

The article is roughly divided into four parts:
The first part will briefly introduce some real project data, including time-consuming data before and after optimization so that friends can understand how much optimization space is there for integration testing, and highlight why integration testing needs to be optimized.
The second part will introduce the composition of integration test execution time through some examples so that everyone knows where the time is spent.
In the third part, I will remove the "cloud" of the Spring test framework source code, and take the friends to briefly understand the principles of Spring integration testing.
Finally, I will give some useful suggestions for optimizing the execution time of Spring integration tests.
Integration Testing
Here are a few words. We have been pursuing automated testing for a long time. The fundamental reason is that automated testing is more reliable and cheaper than humans. Integration testing is an integral part of automated testing.]]></summary>

Without support for multiple languages, it is simply the URL + the angular route. With Angular i18n the different directories for the language build need to be supported. This article shows how to support language-independent deep linking. The AngularAndSpring project will serve as an example. It is a Spring Boot application that provides the backend with the rest endpoints and serves the Angular frontend in the 'resources/static/' directory.

We appreciate this effort and the great results of open-source technology. In that article, Rick used the popular Star Schema Benchmark (SSB). 
We know this benchmark very well. One of Altinity founders and Percona CTO Vadim Tkachenko uses it quite regularly when comparing different open source analytical options (in 2017 and in 2020). A few weeks ago another real-time analytics company Rockset published their results claiming much better performance and efficiency compared to Druid.

Today, I will show you what this API evolution looks like through the subsequent Java releases and what were the reasons for its introduction to Java. I hope that it will give you some more knowledge about Optional class itself, help to convince your coworkers to start using it instead of a simple null check or even to decide which Java version to use in your company or private project.]]></summary>

With IoT technology moving as fast as it is, there is a lot of new technology to keep up with. It can be difficult to stay informed on the latest tech to facilitate a potential solution. In this article, we will break down four established asset tracking technologies to better understand their ideal use case in asset tracking. 
As is often the case, some of the newest options are the most expensive and feature-rich. Meanwhile, other options have dropped in cost due to large-scale adoption. A new generation of Bluetooth Low Energy, (BLE), Radio Frequency Identification (RFID), Long Range (LoRa), and Ultra-Wide Band (UWB) have brought new possibilities to industries hoping to solve the problem of, where did that thing go?]]></summary>

First, we have to configure everything from the integrated development environment (IDE) to build tools such as Maven or Gradle. We also need to configure the command-line tools used for containerization and generating the Kubernetes manifest. If we don’t want to spin up a Kubernetes cluster locally, we also must connect to a remote Kubernetes cluster for continuous testing and deployment.
Developers should spend less time on configuration and more time accelerating the inner-loop development cycle of building, testing, and deploying our applications. Ideally, we should be able to continuously develop applications in a pre-configured Kubernetes environment.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Introduction
We are in the Digital Economy and as it applies to all economies in the world, the success of this relatively new but no longer nascent economy will depend on how well the stakeholders of this economy maximize their resources by reusing, replicating, connecting, and interoperating them. The value of synergy is always greater than the value of individual components contributing to it and this force multiplier needs to be capitalized in a massive way by modern-day enterprises if they wish to succeed in the digital economy.
The advertisement moolah that Google and Facebook rake in is precisely because they do not look at their business entities in siloes; rather they connect and integrate valuable customer data points from various entities like; for example, Gmail, Google Maps, and YouTube to generate one unified persona related data impression that becomes the basis for their targeted advertisements and their consequent success rates. Likewise, Netflix integrates and converts data on the subscriber consumption pattern to intelligent movie recommendations that lead to higher viewership, greater new subscriptions, and improved Net Promoter Scores (read word of mouth).]]></summary>

You may not realize it, but machines can read these incredibly nuanced subtilities of human expressions, and retailers can use it to their advantage. A device loaded with a specific software program can predict whether a person is smiling out of frustration or joy. Human-computer interaction has gone beyond the realms of sci-fi fantasies and turned into reality. The rise of emotionally aware machines has blurred the human-machine divide, and it is now redefining the way people experience technology.
What Is Affective Computing? 
Emotion AI, also known as Affective Computing, is all about how AI can decode the emotional status of a human being by analyzing their facial expressions, such as head motion, facial distortions, movement of jaws, and speech pattern, etc. It detects, recognizes, and emulates human emotions through a programmed AI neural network. Without a doubt, humans can analyze and interpret complex emotional signals better. However, the gap is narrowing faster than you can imagine, thanks to advancements in big data capability and powerful algorithms.]]></summary>

Thanks to the rich abstractions Kubernetes provides, deploying software on-premises can be significantly easier than it used to be. Because Kubernetes has achieved such high market penetration (and still growing), it is now a viable target environment for many software products. Nevertheless, Kubernetes requires external tools to be production ready, especially on an on-prem deployment.
The purpose of this article is to list tools that everyone should be aware of when it’s time to move an on-prem Kubernetes cluster to production, and by on-prem, we mean not in a cloud environment. In the cloud, it is obviously better to rely on cloud services offered by the provider.]]></summary>

Smart parking development implies an IoT-based system that sends data about free and occupied parking places via web/mobile applications. The IoT device, including sensors and microcontrollers, is located in each parking place. The user receives a live update about the availability of all parking places and chooses the best one.
In order to investigate the technologies behind the smart parking solution, we implemented an internal research project. The main idea was the creation of smart parking using the Internet of Things and ultrasonic sensors, where available parking places could be displayed in a web application.]]></summary>

The software testing process is an ever-shifting entity. It has to keep changing to accommodate changing requirements, device-browser-OS releases, and numerous other factors that show up with increasing frequency. Inability to change will cause the pipeline to stagnate and roll out software that doesn’t match current performance and design standards.
Testing Maturity designates the extent to which the process is optimized and formalized to accept and incorporate changes. This ranges from ad-hoc practices, formally established stages, result metrics, and optimization efforts on each level. Testing Maturity reveals how well the process is shaped, measured, managed, monitored and the results it yields.]]></summary>

Most importantly, the mandate had a laser focus on the fact that APIs need the network effect to produce the most value, and thus it simply said that APIs are not optional anymore.

If you’re a MySQL DBA or a developer that deals with MySQL instances daily, it will probably not come as a surprise if you hear that you should not run big data sets on MySQL. Ask almost any MySQL DBA, and you will hear something like:
"MySQL is not a fit!"
"Have you looked into NoSQL?"
"Use MongoDB."
Some of these responses indeed have merit — for example, NoSQL-based database management systems such as MongoDB can certainly be useful when dealing with big data sets. However, contrary to popular belief, MySQL shouldn’t be so quickly ruled out — in some scenarios, MySQL (or MariaDB) might prove to be even better options for big data than their NoSQL counterparts! In this article, we will explore the things you should consider when answering the question: “Is MySQL a good option for my big data project?”]]></summary>

Financial debt is an arrangement that gives the borrowing party permission to borrow money under the condition that it is to be paid back at a later date, usually with interest. Financial debt is generally needed due to overspending, lack of financial knowledge, poorly managed budget, etc. to name a few. You might also raise a financial debt to invest in your capital-intensive business, education, etc. which would bring returns in the future. Financial debt is not always a bad thing as long as you're aware of the consequences and always keep it under control.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[CockroachDB is a cloud-native SQL database that features both scalability and consistency. The database is designed to withstand data center failures by deploying multiple instances of symmetric nodes in a cluster consisting of several machines, disks, and data centers.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Doling out advice, hurling negative comments, passing mean remarks – we have all done it. Given an opportunity, it’s easy to assume the role of an expert and tell others how wrong they are, why their product isn’t good enough, why their idea will never work, how they should behave, what they should do. Why seek permission when we feel right in our criticism?
Now let’s turn this around. Are your critics telling you the blunt facts you need to hear? Think for a moment about how you feel when you are on the receiving end of this criticism – angry, defensive, resentful, frustrated, sad, maybe even a little bit devastated.]]></summary>

Agile helps teams to become more flexible and adaptive which is essential for staying competitive in today’s business environment where customer needs are constantly changing and evolving. But what exactly do we mean by being “more flexible and adaptive?”
Request Management: Product Increments
Let’s imagine a team that is working on a software product. The product is going to be released in several versions, and the Product Manager creates a roadmap to plan the timeline for these releases (please see the picture below). Each release itself can be broken down into smaller chunks of work that are usually called product increments and form a Sprint (typically 2-4 weeks long).]]></summary>

In order to bridge the gap of delivering products quickly, all organizations are shifting the base architectural design patterns to distributed system architecture. It's kind of common practice to either bootstrap or transition the existing applications to containerized or server-less architectures.
Managing clustered applications can soon become an overhead when the organization scale and hence increases a dire need for a platform that can support automation of all the tasks related to management, deployment, scaling of these clusters.]]></summary>

Instead of coding software line-by-line by hand, use a low-code tool that provided visual abstractions that enabled developers to shortcut the hand-coding process by dragging and dropping tasks onto workflows, widgets onto screens, and the like.
Then along came no-code. The contrast between the two approaches was clear. Low-code targeted professional developers, simplifying their work by taking ‘plumbing’ tasks off their plate, while also facilitating collaboration with business stakeholders.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Engineering teams can scale their Kubernetes costs and burn their budget with the same ease by which they scale their infrastructure. Thanks to Kubecost's real-time alerting, the risk of upsetting the finance team can be mitigated. Kubernetes is well-known for its ability to help scale applications rapidly and with ease, but this ability comes with some tradeoffs. Before Kubernetes, teams had to follow a more deliberate procurement approval process to change the capacity allocation. Today, that scaling process has been democratized, and teams can easily scale their clusters up or down.
With the ability to create more frequent changes to infrastructure resources come more opportunities to misallocate and over-allocate costly resources. In this model, technical teams can far exceed their expense budget without even realizing it, while financial managers would only notice it after the fact leading to avoidable organizational stress. So, how do you stay on top of your Kubernetes spending if your resources change daily?]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There are certain industries that greatly benefit from high-performing, low-latency, geo-distributed technologies, while other organizations might be more focused on vertically scaling architectures. This is dependent on numerous factors including the data pipeline, network, data structure, type of product or solution, short and long-term goals, etc. While there are currently many databases and tools that provide vertical scaling capabilities, there are not many that focus on horizontal scaling -- but there’s still a need for both.
Latency
Before jumping into specific industries that benefit from high-performing, low-latency, geo-distributed databases (it’s a mouthful, I know), let’s define a few terms here. High-performing is pretty self-explanatory so I’ll skip over that one. For the next term, I’ll refer to my colleague Jacob Cohen’s blog on Geo-Distributed Databases. Latency generally measures the duration between an action and a response. In user-facing applications, that can be narrowed down to the delay between when a user makes a request and when the application responds to a request. So, technologies that enable low latency usually improve performance and response times, leading to improved user experience and cost savings.]]></summary>

Years ago I analyzed Cassandra 1.2.6 and found pretty big cycle groups for Java files as well as for packages. The maintainability level was only 9.4% (everything under 50% is concerning) while the metric “Propagation Cost” has a value of 62%. That means that every change will affect 62% of all code directly or indirectly which also is not a good thing because it significantly increases the chance of regression bugs.

In the post, OP mentions a couple of things driving the motivation for the transition. One is a concern that they may be losing development skills because they’re spending so much time creating scripts and automating. The other reason is that they’re having trouble adjusting to on-call life.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[1. Choice of Programming Language
The language depends on the type of cluster. A cluster can comprise of two modes, i.e., Standard and High Concurrency. A High Concurrency cluster supports R, Python, and SQL, whereas a Standard cluster supports Scala, Java, SQL, Python, and R.
Spark is developed in Scala and is the underlying processing engine of Databricks. Scala performs better than Python and SQL. Hence, for the Standard cluster, Scala is the recommended language for developing Spark jobs.
2. ADF for Invoking Databricks Notebooks
Eliminate Hardcoding: In certain scenarios, Databricks requires some configuration information related to other Azure services such as storage account name, database server name, etc. The ADF pipeline uses pipeline variables for storing the configuration details. During the Databricks notebook invocation within the ADF pipeline, the configuration details are transferred from pipeline variables to Databricks widget variables, thereby eliminating hardcoding in the Databricks notebooks.
Notebook Dependencies: It is relatively easier to establish notebook dependencies in ADF than in Databricks itself. In case of failure, debugging a series of notebook invocations in an ADF pipeline is convenient.

Cheap: When a Notebook is invoked through ADF, the Ephemeral job cluster pattern is used for processing the spark job because the lifecycle of the cluster is tied to the job lifecycle. These short-life clusters cost lesser than the clusters which are created using the Databricks UI.
3. Using Widget Variables
The configuration details are made accessible to the Databricks code through the widget variables. The configuration data is transferred from pipeline variable to widget variables when the notebook is invoked in the ADF pipeline. During the development phase, to model the behavior of a notebook run by ADF, widget variables are manually created using the following line of code.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It is incredible just how much information we have today stored in PDF format. According to the PDF Association, approximately 2.5 trillion PDFs are created every year, making up 6 percent of the web. As a web developer, though, PDFs aren't always the most outstanding experience online:
Viewing experiences vary significantly across different users and devices because they depend on a PDF viewer. Whether it is embedded in web browsers or free online libraries, some viewers are better than others. Adobe Acrobat Reader is generally the universal standard for viewing PDFs properly. Google Chrome is also very common. However, many things have worked in Acrobat that still don't work or render correctly in Chrome.
It becomes difficult for me to be able to incorporate PDFs into the rest of my website. Most often, PDFs would prompt users to download PDFs on their devices.
Converting PDFs to HTML is complicated and unreliable. If I want to present content inside a webpage that is in PDF format, I might often flatten it to PDF to make it easier to embed.
I have no visibility into how my visitor is viewing those PDFs. This means that I have no idea if someone is reading certain pages, how long they spend on those pages, etc.
Fortunately, Adobe PDF Embed is an excellent solution to solve all of these challenges.]]></summary>

It’s about the willingness to step up, put yourself out there, and lean into courage.” In today’s cultural and work environment, we’re no longer able to avoid sensitive and pressing issues, but many leaders are paralyzed by the fear of making mistakes in the way they address them. This is especially true when it comes to addressing concerns around diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI).
That’s why our host, Federico Toledo, wraps up season three of Quality Sense with an illuminating interview with a leader in the DEI space. Ash Coleman has had a very unique and interesting career path that has led her to her current role as the Head of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion at Credit Karma. Before that, she was a professional chef who made a transition into software testing. These professional experiences have led her to understand what goes into making amazing experiences and products that meet the requirements of a diverse population.]]></summary>
